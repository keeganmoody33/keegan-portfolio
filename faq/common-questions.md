# Common Questions

## What You Do

### What do you actually do?

I'm a GTM Engineer — I build the infrastructure that makes revenue machines work. Prospecting systems, outbound automation, ICP frameworks, campaign architecture. I'm the person in the lab with the whiteboard, engineering the pieces that feed the flywheel.

Think of it like building a car: I design the transmission, the headers, the exhaust — the systems that make the engine run. Then I hand it to the people who drive it.

---

### What are you building right now?

A few things. I've been deep in the technical side lately — building tools with Claude, experimenting with APIs, vibe-coding some ideas I've had for a while. Some are half-baked, some are getting close to real.

On the portfolio side, this whole system — the AI, the JD analyzer, the infrastructure — is something I built from scratch while learning Next.js and Supabase. First time doing any of it.

---

### How do you find leads and opportunities?

Digging. That's the word. I dig for the right signal — whether it's leads, public APIs, or information hiding in opposite corners that I blend together for pain-based segmentation.

At Trace Air, I sourced 18 of 23 demos from outside the CRM in my first full month. LinkedIn, videos, giving out my phone number — whatever it took. At Biofourmis, I was feeding 6 AEs across North America as a co-founding SDR with enterprise healthcare accounts.

I don't spray and pray. I find the diamonds in the dirt.

## Your Background

### What's your background?

Scientist-trained, blue-collar roots. First-gen college student. Worked with my hands before I worked with my head.

Fell in love with organic chemistry in college — not the grades, the learning. Understood that once you get the foundational concepts, you can spin them however you want. That's how I approach everything now.

After college, I got into hip-hop production — sampling, MPC, making something great from two mediocre records. That constraint-driven creativity carried into startups. Building GTM systems isn't that different from building a beat.

### Tell me about the Mixmax project

First time building GTM infrastructure from zero. No playbook, no predecessor — just me and a whiteboard.

What I built:
- 53-inbox email infrastructure across multiple providers
- ICP validation across 280 customers ($4.79M ARR analyzed)
- 9-agent AI orchestration system for outbound
- Full methodology documentation for handoff

The company had been running on PLG with no outbound for over a year. I came in to build it from scratch — worked directly with the CRO daily. By the time the infrastructure was production-ready, the company's priorities had shifted. But the system works. They have everything they need to execute.

---

### What are your biggest wins?

**Trace Air:** $220K generated in 90 days. 23 demos in my first fully onboarded month — 18 self-sourced from outside the CRM. Built a greenfield territory from nothing for a new AE.

**Biofourmis:** Co-founding SDR feeding 6 AEs across all of North America. Enterprise healthcare — hospitals, academic medical centers. Orlando Health deal closed in 90 days, $1M+ lifetime value, still active today.

**Mixmax:** Built complete GTM infrastructure from zero. First time doing any of it. Documented everything for the next person.

## What You're Looking For

### What kind of role are you looking for?

Founding GTM Engineer. Growth. Early team member at a company that's elite or building toward elite.

I want to be at the seam of product — not just pushing pipeline, but influencing what gets built. Sitting in on product meetings, bringing customer feedback, helping shape the roadmap.

I need elite teammates who want to win. I don't thrive alone. Collaboration, someone to push back on my ideas, people to learn from.

---

### What do you need to succeed?

Autonomy with engagement. Not isolation, not micromanagement — the middle.

Specifically:
- Weekly syncs at minimum
- Someone who'll redirect me when I'm going too deep
- Clear, time-bound deliverables
- Collaboration — I want to bring something and have someone say "whoa, this is sick" and build on it

I want to be a resource for people. Not just left alone to figure it out.

---

### What are your non-negotiables?

- **Remote or Atlanta-based** — might travel 2 days/week if it's not in Atlanta, but that's the flexibility
- **Not a BDR/SDR role** — I'm a GTM Engineer, Growth, early team member. The exception would be a truly elite company that would level up my skills significantly
- **Elite teammates** — I don't want to be around people who don't take their work seriously

---

### What are your comp expectations?

- Floor: $120K base
- Target: $150-180K total comp
- Open to equity upside in the right situation

---

## Harder Questions

### Why have you had multiple short stints?

I've had some short stints. Learned that producing results isn't enough — optics, politics, and communication matter too.

I came up as a producer. Led teams in results, originated enterprise deals, built territories from nothing. But I wasn't always great at managing how that looked or navigating the politics around it.

Each role I've come back sharper. Clearer about what I need. More intentional about how I communicate. Looking for the right long-term fit where I can grow — I've never been promoted and I want to change that.

---

### What's a weakness you're working on?

Shipping speed. I tend to build frameworks when the job is to ship campaigns. I'll look for the perfect sample when the job is to press play.

What I've learned: I need someone engaged enough to say "ship it ugly and iterate." Autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me. I thrive when there's a deadline and someone to push back.

I'm operating on "ship first, buzzer-beater second" now.

---

### Can you close deals?

Not yet — that's not where my experience is. I've originated deals, including Orlando Health ($1M+ LTV, 90-day close). But I've never carried a quota as an AE or owned the close myself.

My strength is top-of-funnel: prospecting, ICP development, pipeline generation, GTM infrastructure. I'd need training and mentorship to move into closing.

---

### Can you manage people?

Not yet. I've led by influence — advocated for teammates, mentored, built processes that others used. But I've never had direct reports.

It's something I want to grow into. Would need to start small and learn.

---

## Personal

### What's the music stuff about?

Sample-based hip-hop production. Technics SL-1200 MK2 turntables — one signed by Slick Rick. MPC 2000 XL.

The philosophy: diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight. Making something great from two mediocre records and a lot of digging.

Same mindset applies to prospecting. Same mindset applies to building GTM systems. Constraint-driven creativity.

---

### What's the IROC-Z?

1987 Camaro IROC-Z. Bought it for $5K from Indiana. Full teardown and rebuild — frame off, body work, rust repair.

You learn by taking things apart. Same approach I take to understanding GTM systems, products, markets.

---

### What's Camp Horizon?

Annual volunteer program for foster children ages 8-12 in Fulton and DeKalb County, Georgia. Only 1:1 camper-to-counselor ratio program in the Southeast.

4 consecutive years with the same camper. Sleep in the same bunk for a full week. I could be the most influential male in this kid's life.

---

### What have you been learning lately?

Getting up to speed in the computer science realm. Building tools, experimenting with APIs, teaching myself Next.js and Supabase by building this portfolio.

It's been no small task, but I'm feeling good about where I'm at. It's amplified my creativity — now I can actually build the ideas I've been thinking about.
