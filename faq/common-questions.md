## Career Questions

### Why did you leave medicine?

**Short answer:** I got accepted to medical school (Miami) and turned it down after seeing the business side of healthcare up close.

**Real answer:** Working at Barbour Orthopedics showed me what happens behind the scenes — inflated treatments, backroom deals with lawyers, patients as revenue sources. I was turned off by the business aspect. I realized I could impact the community in ways beyond delivery of care.

### Why have you had multiple short stints?

**Honest answer:** I've been fired twice while being the top performer. Both times, I produced elite results but didn't play the game well enough.

- **Biofourmis:** Led team in results quarter over quarter, but didn't hit activity metrics (80 calls/day). They kept the "follow the rules" person.
- **Trace Air:** 20 demos in one month, 18 self-sourced. Got fired after standing up for the team on a call.

**What I learned:** Optics matter. I'm committing to proving things with numbers THEY care about, not just results. Same message, different delivery.

### What happened at Mixmax?

**Honest answer:** I had everything I wanted — full autonomy, full budget, CRO in my corner. And I didn't deliver.

I was asked to deliver 9,000 contacts across 3 campaigns by December 12. I delivered ~3,770. I got lost building "perfect" frameworks instead of shipping campaigns.

**What I learned:** Full autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me. I need someone engaged enough to redirect when I'm going too deep. "Ship first. Buzzer-beater second" is now my operating principle.

---

### What's the gap period about?

After Biofourmis, I couldn't find the right opportunity for 6+ months. I refused to take a "smile and dial" job just for a paycheck. I was pushing carts at Home Depot while doing consulting work on the side (Josh Pappas projects, BariNav). I stayed in the game while waiting for something real.

## Skills Questions

### Can you close deals?

**Honest answer:** No, not yet. I've originated deals — including Orlando Health ($1M+ lifetime value, 90-day close). But I've never carried a quota as an AE or closed deals myself. I would need training and mentorship on negotiation, objection handling, and contract mechanics.

---

### Do you have formal sales training?

No. I've never had MEDDIC, Sandler, Challenger, or any structured sales methodology training. I learned by doing. This means I might have bad habits I don't know about, but it also means I built my own prospecting methodologies from scratch.

---

### Can you manage people?

Not yet. I've never had direct reports. I've led by influence — advocating for peers, mentoring, building processes. But I don't have people management experience. I'd need to start with 1-2 direct reports and mentorship.

---

### Can you write code?

No. I'm not an engineer. I can work with technical teams, understand architecture, talk about Kafka buses and APIs — but I don't write production code. Don't put me in a role where coding is required.

---

## Fit Questions

### What kind of manager do you work best with?

Someone secure who wants me to win. I need:
- Weekly syncs at minimum
- Willingness to redirect me when I'm going too deep
- Clear, time-bound deliverables
- Feedback on both what's working and what's not

**Red flag:** Managers who feel threatened by me. It's happened twice. They find reasons to push me out even when I'm the top performer.

---

### What environment do you struggle in?

1. **Metrics theater:** Activity for activity's sake. 80 calls/day when 20 focused calls produces better outcomes.
2. **Full autonomy with no check-ins:** I'll disappear into framework-building.
3. **Heavy micromanagement:** Scripted calls and mandatory talk tracks suffocate me.
4. **Solo operator roles:** I need collaboration. It takes more than me to create.

---

### Why should we hire you despite the short stints?

Because I produce results. Orlando Health ($1M+ LTV). 20 demos in one month with 18 self-sourced. Greenfield territory built with 1/4 the contacts of peers.

The short stints weren't about capability — they were about fit and optics. I've learned those lessons. I'm committing to:
- Ship first, buzzer-beater second
- Prove things with numbers THEY care about
- Pick battles more carefully
- Request check-ins even when they don't offer them

I'm not looking to hop again. I want to prove I can grow within a company.

## Personal Questions

### What's the music stuff about?

Sample-based hip-hop production. Technics SL-1200 MK2 turntables (one signed by Slick Rick), MPC 2000 XL.

Philosophy: "Diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight." The same sampling mindset applies to prospecting — digging for what others miss.

I won't release until it's a cohesive project worth putting on wax.

---

### What's the IROC-Z?

1987 Camaro IROC-Z. Bought for $5k from Indiana. Full teardown and rebuild — frame off, body work, rust repair.

"You learn by taking things apart." Same approach I take to GTM systems.

---

### What's Camp Horizon?

Annual volunteer program for foster children (ages 8-12) in Fulton and DeKalb County, Georgia. Only 1:1 camper-to-counselor ratio program in the Southeast.

4 consecutive years with the same camper. Sleep in the same bunk for a full week. "I could be the most influential male in this kid's life."

---

### Who's Dr. Kiefer?

My mentor from Mercer. Organic chemistry professor who took me to South America for 270 days of field research.

What he taught me:
- "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop."
- "You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."
- There are things I've done to be proud of (I still struggle with this)
