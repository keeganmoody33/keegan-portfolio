## Public Resume Version

### GTM Strategy & Market Intelligence | Mobb AI
*January 2025 (Contract)*

- Developed pain-based segmentation framework targeting pre-IPO companies facing SEC cybersecurity compliance gaps, identifying $202M total addressable market across four urgency tiers
- Created proprietary "Existential Data Point" formula (Days to IPO ÷ Days to Clear Compliance) to score and prioritize prospects by conversion likelihood
- Pioneered early adoption of Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture—specifically SEC EDGAR integration—to automate regulatory filing analysis and detect compliance crisis signals in real-time
- Built detection methodology combining SEC comment letters, material weakness disclosures, and 2023 cybersecurity rule gaps to identify companies where IPO timelines were mathematically blocked
- Contributed to Product Hunt launch strategy for Mobb Vibe Shield, positioning the product within the emerging MCP ecosystem for CI/CD security tooling

**Key Outcome:** Segmentation model projected 85% of revenue potential concentrated in top two crisis segments (EDP < 0.7), enabling focused outbound targeting with premium pricing justification.

## Private Portfolio Deep-Dive

### Project: IPO Security Compliance Crisis — Pain-Based Segmentation

#### The Problem

Mobb AI is a code vulnerability remediation platform. The GTM challenge: how do you find companies who *need* automated vulnerability fixing right now—not someday?

Traditional firmographic targeting (company size, industry, tech stack) doesn't answer the urgency question. We needed to identify companies experiencing genuine, time-sensitive pain.

#### The Insight

Pre-IPO companies can't afford security vulnerabilities:

- **SEC comment letters** on cybersecurity literally block IPOs
- **Material weaknesses** require public disclosure to investors
- **2023 SEC cybersecurity rules** created new compliance gaps
- **Timeline pressure** makes remediation speed existential

This isn't a "nice to have." This is existential pain with a deadline.

---

### What I Built

#### 1. Existential Data Point (EDP) Formula

```
EDP = Days Until IPO ÷ Days to Clear Compliance Issues
```

**Interpretation:**
- **EDP < 1.0** → IPO is mathematically impossible without intervention
- **EDP 0.1-0.3** → Crisis mode, IPO blocked
- **EDP 0.3-0.7** → Emergency, IPO at serious risk
- **EDP 0.7-1.2** → Urgent but manageable
- **EDP > 1.2** → Prevention-focused, lower urgency

This single metric segments the entire market by urgency and predicts conversion likelihood.

#### 2. Pain-Based Segmentation Model

| Segment | EDP Range | Situation | Conversion Rate | ACV | ARR Potential |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----|---------------|
| **SEC Comment Crisis** | 0.1-0.3 | Active SEC comment letter on cybersecurity; 10-14 day response deadline | 85% | $500K-2M | $112M (56%) |
| **Material Weakness Emergency** | 0.3-0.7 | Security-related material weaknesses identified; disclosure required | 65% | $200K-800K | $58M (29%) |
| **New Rule Scramble** | 0.7-1.2 | 2023 SEC cybersecurity rule compliance gaps | 40% | $100K-400K | $24M (12%) |
| **Proactive Preparation** | >1.2 | No current issues; prevention-focused | 15% | $50K-150K | $8M (3%) |

**Total Addressable Revenue: $202M**

**Strike Zone:** Top two segments represent 85% of revenue potential with highest conversion rates and premium pricing justification.

#### 3. Detection Signals (All Public Record)

**SEC Comment Crisis Detection:**
- SEC comment letter mentions "cybersecurity"
- Response deadline visible in EDGAR correspondence
- Multiple filing amendments
- Legal counsel additions for cybersecurity matters

**Material Weakness Detection:**
- Material weakness disclosure in S-1 filing
- IT/cybersecurity control failures noted
- Auditor findings on security controls
- Investment bank due diligence flags

**New Rule Compliance Gap Detection:**
- Missing cybersecurity governance disclosures
- No incident response procedures documented
- Board oversight documentation gaps
- Gap analysis vs. 2023 SEC requirements

**Proactive Preparation Detection:**
- IPO timeline announced 6+ months out
- No current compliance issues
- Investment bank selection in progress
- Board governance improvements underway

---

#### 4. MCP Integration (Early Adopter)

**Technical Innovation:**
- Used SEC EDGAR MCP server while still in beta (one of the earliest adopters)
- Automated regulatory filing analysis within Claude's local environment
- Built workflow to detect compliance crisis signals programmatically
- Demonstrated how emerging AI architecture could transform GTM intelligence

**Why This Matters:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) was brand new—this was cutting-edge adoption
- Showed how agentic AI workflows could automate market signal detection
- Combined traditional GTM strategy with technical implementation
- Positioned as forward-thinking in the evolving martech landscape

### Strategic Framework Applied

This work applied the **Cannonball GTM Methodology**:

1. **Focus** — Identified pre-IPO companies as the high-urgency segment
2. **Investigate** — Used SEC EDGAR data, LinkedIn hiring patterns, and audit activity as signal sources
3. **Narrate** — Built messaging around the EDP concept ("Your IPO is mathematically blocked")
4. **Deploy** — Created prioritization framework for outbound targeting

**Key Methodology Concepts Used:**
- Pain-Based Segmentation (not firmographic)
- Existential Data Point (the metric that creates urgency)
- Permissionless Value Proposition thinking (insights prospects would pay to receive)

---

### What Didn't Ship (But Still Matters)

**Product Hunt Launch Plan — Mobb Vibe Shield:**
- Developed positioning strategy for MCP-native security products
- Identified early adopter developer audience
- Created narrative around CI/CD pipeline integration
- Plan was developed but not deployed during engagement

**Why Include This:**
- Demonstrates strategic thinking beyond what shipped
- Shows range from market analysis to product positioning
- Documents contribution to broader company effort during MCP product race

---

### Key Learnings & Principles

1. **Regulatory pressure creates the most urgent pain**
   - Companies facing SEC deadlines have no choice but to act
   - Timeline pressure transforms "nice to have" into "must have"

2. **Public data is underutilized for GTM**
   - SEC filings, comment letters, and material weakness disclosures are all public
   - Most competitors aren't mining regulatory data for sales signals

3. **Early adoption of AI tooling creates differentiation**
   - Being among the first to use MCP for regulatory analysis provided unique capability
   - Technical sophistication + strategic thinking = competitive advantage

4. **Pain intensity predicts conversion better than company size**
   - A company with EDP < 0.3 will convert at 85% regardless of size
   - Traditional TAM analysis misses urgency dimension entirely

---

### Tools & Resources Used

- **Claude MCP Architecture** — SEC EDGAR integration for regulatory filing analysis
- **Pain-Based Segmentation Framework** — Cannonball GTM methodology
- **SEC EDGAR Database** — Primary source for compliance signal detection
- **LinkedIn Data Mining** — Hiring pattern analysis for security leadership additions

---

### Artifacts Produced

1. **Pain-Based Segmentation Map** — Visual quadrant showing four segments by urgency and resources
2. **EDP Scoring Model** — Formula and interpretation guide
3. **Detection Signal Checklist** — Public data sources for each segment
4. **Revenue Breakdown Analysis** — ARR potential by segment with conversion assumptions
5. **Multi-Vector Compliance Radar** — Visualization of how different pressures combine

---

## Summary

This engagement demonstrated the application of modern GTM methodology to a real B2B SaaS challenge. By combining pain-based segmentation, regulatory data analysis, and early adoption of emerging AI architecture, created a targeting framework that prioritized prospects by genuine urgency rather than surface-level firmographics.

**Core Contribution:** A repeatable methodology for identifying companies in compliance crisis, with quantified market sizing and prioritization based on the Existential Data Point formula.
