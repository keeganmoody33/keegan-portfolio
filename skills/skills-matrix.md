## STRONG — Can Do Tomorrow

These are skills I can execute immediately with confidence. No ramp-up needed.

### GTM / Sales Skills

| Skill | Evidence | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Cold Outreach Strategy** | Orlando Health deal (90-day close, $1M+ LTV), 20 demos at Trace Air with 18 self-sourced | I know how to find the right person, craft the right message, and get meetings |
| **Prospecting / Lead Sourcing** | Built methodology at every role — hospital readmission research, land development project hunting | Give me a target market and I'll find the angle nobody else is looking at |
| **ICP Development** | Defined personas at Biofourmis (QA Directors), Trace Air (land developers), Mixmax (sales leaders) | I think in terms of pain points and decision-maker psychology |
| **Personalized Outreach** | Video prospecting at Trace Air, personalized calls at Biofourmis | I don't do spray-and-pray. Every touch is intentional |
| **Territory Development** | Built greenfield territory at Trace Air with 1/4 the contacts of peers | I can create something from nothing |
| **Pain-Based Selling** | Hospital readmission methodology, development project research | I find the problem they're already trying to solve and position as the answer |

### Technical / Tools

| Skill | Evidence | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Clay** | Built full workflows at Mixmax, 12k+ row tables, automated enrichment pipelines | Comfortable with complex Clay tables, views, integrations |
| **Smartlead** | Set up campaigns, domain management, sequencing at Mixmax | Know the platform well |
| **HubSpot** | Used extensively at Biofourmis for sequencing | Solid foundation |
| **Salesforce** | Used at Trace Air and Biofourmis | Can navigate, create reports, manage pipeline |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | Primary prospecting tool at Trace Air | Power user |
| **ZoomInfo / Apollo** | Used at Biofourmis and Mixmax | Know how to pull and enrich data |
| **Excel / Data Manipulation** | Built methodology pairing spectrophotometer data with GPS coordinates | VLOOKUPs, concatenations, data cleaning — this is where my science background shows |
| **ChatGPT / AI Tools** | Used for prospecting research at Trace Air, prompt engineering for GTM | I think in terms of AI-assisted workflows |

### Soft Skills

| Skill | Evidence | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Learning New Domains Quickly** | Digital health (Biofourmis), land development (Trace Air), sales engagement (Mixmax) | Give me a week and I'll understand your market |
| **Building Relationships** | People invest in me before I've proven anything — turntables, MPC, contracts, opportunities | Something about me makes people want to bet on me |
| **Authenticity / Genuine Connection** | "Being personal on the phone. Being genuine. Having a real reason for the call." | I don't fake it. People can tell |
| **Creative Problem Solving** | Hospital readmission methodology, self-sourced contacts, sampling/digging philosophy | I find what's hidden in plain sight |
| **Taking Ownership** | Owned my shortcomings at Mixmax, asked for feedback, sent thorough handoff docs | I don't blame others when I fall short |

### Research / Analysis

| Skill | Evidence | Context |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Research** | 270 days fieldwork in South America, published papers | I know how to design and execute research from scratch |
| **Data Collection & Analysis** | Mercury concentration mapping, heat map creation | Scientific method is in my DNA |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Finding angles in markets (hospital readmissions, land developments) | I see the signal in the noise |
| **Framework Development** | Built methodologies at every role | Maybe too much — this is also a weakness |

## MODERATE — Need Ramp-Up Time

These are skills I have foundations in but would need time to get sharp. 1-4 weeks to be effective.

### GTM / Sales Skills

| Skill | Current Level | What I Need |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Account Executive / Closing** | Have never closed deals myself — always originated for AEs | Would need training on negotiation, objection handling, contract mechanics |
| **Demo Delivery** | Set demos, never ran them | Need product training and practice reps |
| **Pipeline Management** | Understand it conceptually, haven't owned a quota as AE | Need to build discipline around forecasting |
| **Enterprise Sales Cycles** | Originated enterprise deal (Orlando Health) but didn't manage the cycle | Would need mentorship on long-cycle deal management |
| **Multi-Threading** | Did this informally | Need more structured approach to engaging multiple stakeholders |

### Technical / Tools

| Skill | Current Level | What I Need |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Outreach.io / SalesLoft** | Used SalesLoft at Trace Air but system was broken (RevOps issues) | Need clean implementation to really learn it |
| **Gong / Call Recording Analysis** | Understand the value, haven't used extensively | 1-2 weeks to get comfortable |
| **Trigify** | Used at Mixmax but didn't master | Need more time with signal-based prospecting |
| **SQL / Database Queries** | Can do basic queries, not advanced | Would need training for complex analysis |
| **CRM Administration** | User-level proficiency, not admin | Could learn but not immediate strength |

### Soft Skills

| Skill | Current Level | What I Need |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Concise Communication** | I struggle with this when riffing | Active practice, feedback, maybe frameworks |
| **Managing Up** | Have done it poorly (Biofourmis, Trace Air) | Need to learn how to advocate without creating friction |
| **Political Navigation** | Got fired twice partly due to this | Need mentorship on reading rooms and picking battles |
| **Documentation / Process Writing** | Can do it but it's not natural | Need discipline to document as I go, not after |

## GAP — Don't Have This

These are skills I genuinely lack. Would need significant training or should avoid roles requiring these.

### Hard Gaps

| Skill | Honest Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Coding / Engineering** | I'm not a developer. I can work with technical teams, understand concepts, but I don't write code |
| **Formal Sales Training (MEDDIC, Sandler, etc.)** | Never had structured sales methodology training. Learned by doing |
| **People Management** | Have never managed direct reports. Led by influence, not authority |
| **Financial Modeling** | Don't have this skill. Could learn basics but not a strength |
| **Marketing Execution** | Not my lane — copywriting, ad creative, campaign management |
| **Product Management** | Understand the role, have never done it |
| **Customer Success / Account Management** | Post-sale is not my zone. I'm hunter, not farmer |
| **RevOps / Salesforce Administration** | User-level only. Don't know how to architect the backend |
| **Paid Acquisition** | No experience with paid media, performance marketing |

### Gaps I Could Fill With Training

| Skill | What It Would Take |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Closing Deals** | 3-6 months of AE experience with good coaching |
| **Formal Sales Methodology** | Structured training program (MEDDIC, Challenger, etc.) |
| **People Management** | Would need to start with 1-2 direct reports, mentorship |
| **Basic SQL** | Online course + practice, 2-4 weeks |
| **RevOps Fundamentals** | Shadowing + course, 1-2 months |
