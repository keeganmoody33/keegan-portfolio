# Values & Preferences

---

## Core Values

### Authenticity Over Veneer
- "Being personal on the phone. Being genuine. Having a real reason for the call."
- I don't fake enthusiasm. I need to believe in what I'm selling.
- Substance over polish. Real over performed.

### Impact Over Activity
- 20 focused calls beats 80 spray-and-pray dials
- Results should speak, but I've learned optics matter too
- Quality prospecting > volume metrics

### Ownership
- I don't blame others when I fall short
- At Mixmax, I owned my shortcomings in final message
- Asked for feedback, sent thorough handoff docs

### Community Impact
- "A lot of people complain about the community. Very few are actually out there trying to impact change."
- Camp Horizon volunteer — 4 years with same camper
- Teaching, coaching, EMT work before sales

### Creative Problem Solving
- "Diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight."
- Hospital readmission methodology, self-sourced contacts
- Sampling philosophy from music applied to prospecting

## Work Preferences

### Environment I Thrive In

| Preference | Why |
|------------|-----|
| **Autonomy with guardrails** | Freedom to build my way, but with clear outcomes and check-ins |
| **Engaged leadership** | Weekly syncs minimum. Someone who has time to redirect me. |
| **Clear deadlines** | Without them, I'll build forever. Time-bound deliverables work for me. |
| **Creative team** | People to push against. Someone elite to learn from. |
| **Product with real value** | I can't fake enthusiasm for something that doesn't help people. |
| **Path to growth** | I've never been promoted. I want to prove I can grow within a company. |

### Environment I Struggle In

| Type | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Metrics theater** | Activity for activity's sake kills my motivation |
| **Full autonomy with no check-ins** | I'll disappear into framework-building |
| **Heavy micromanagement** | Scripted calls and mandatory talk tracks suffocate me |
| **Solo operator role** | I need collaboration. It takes more than me to create. |

## Communication Style

### Strengths
- Written outreach — intentional, personalized, thoughtful
- Authentic conversation — people can tell I'm genuine
- Relationship building — people invest in me before I've proven anything

### Growth Areas
- Concise verbal communication — I go too long when riffing
- Managing up — learning to advocate without creating friction
- Political navigation — picking battles more carefully

### What I'm Working On
- Write it down before I say it
- Lead with the bottom line, then explain
- Ask "Is this landing?" and adjust
- Leave room for others

## Philosophy

### On Learning
> "Once I understood I could learn anything, accomplish anything, once I broke through that barrier, it opened up so many doors."

### On Approach
> "Give me the ability to hunt, cook, and clean my own food — I'll produce more than any SDR."

### On Music
> "I want to release a project that can be put on wax and be here forever."

### On Impact
> "A lot of people complain about the community. Very few are actually out there trying to impact change."

### On the Commitment
> "Ship first. Buzzer-beater second."

## The Influences

### Dr. Adam Kiefer (Mentor)

- "You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."
- First to show me there are things I've done to be proud of

### Musical Influences
- Organized Noize / The Dungeon — Atlanta lineage
- Goodie Mob, Mobb Deep, Gang Starr, MF DOOM, Freddie Gibbs & Madlib
- "Substance over polish. Authenticity over veneer."

### The IROC-Z Philosophy

- "You learn by taking things apart"
- Same approach to GTM systems
