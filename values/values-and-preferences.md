# Values & Preferences

What I'm building toward and what I need to thrive.

---

## The Setup Where I Thrive

### Autonomy + Engagement
Not full isolation. Not micromanagement. The middle.

I need room to think, build, and find my own angles. But I also need someone engaged — weekly syncs, feedback, someone who'll redirect me when I'm going too deep. Left completely alone, I'll build forever. With the right co-pilot, I ship.

### Elite Teammates
I want to be sharpened by people better than me. Teammates who take their work seriously, who are passionate about winning, who collaborate because they want the whole team to succeed.

I don't thrive alone. It takes more than me to create.

### Product-Adjacent Work
I want to be at the seam of product and GTM. Not just pushing pipeline — influencing what gets built. Sitting in on product meetings, bringing customer feedback, helping shape the roadmap, scoping features.

That's where I feel like I add the most value.

### Building, Not Just Executing
I'm a maker. I want to build process, applications, solutions — not just run someone else's playbook. Give me the whiteboard and let me engineer the pieces that feed the flywheel.

### Learning Environment
I need to be learning. New challenges, new tools, people to learn from. The monotony of doing the same thing every day wears on me. Dynamic environments where I'm constantly growing — that's where I light up.

|----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Founding GTM Engineer, Growth, Early Team Member |
| **Company** | Elite or building toward elite. Innovative. Doing something real. |
| **Location** | Remote or Atlanta-based. Open to travel 2 days/week if not in Atlanta. |

## The Journey I Want

### 3-Year Vision
- **Employed consistently** — part of a journey, not hopping
- **Promoted or publicly leveled up** — proof I can grow inside a company
- **Built meaningful things** — features shipped, ideas brought to life, impact I can point to
- **Deeper network** — real relationships, not just LinkedIn connections
- **More technical** — continuing to build skills, layer in creativity
- **Leadership path emerging** — maybe starting to manage, definitely influencing

### What Success Looks Like
Being able to say: "I was the reason this shipped. I was part of this team from A to X. I grew here."

## How I Work Best

### Communication
I'm better when I write it down first. When I'm riffing verbally, ideas can get lost. Give me a minute to organize, and I'll lead with the bottom line.

### Collaboration
I want to bring something and have someone say "whoa, this is sick" — then build on it together. I want people to come to me with problems and ideas. I want to be a resource, not just a lone operator.

### Creativity
My best work has my fingerprints on it. The sampling mentality — finding diamonds in dirt, doing more with less, making something great from constraints. That's when I'm most engaged.

### Focus
I go deep, not wide. I need time to sit with problems, not get pulled in 10 directions. Like music — nothing sits with you quite like something that's been in rotation for a while.

---

## Core Values

### Authenticity
I'm not trying to be someone I'm not. I'm a builder from blue-collar roots with a scientist's mind and a producer's creativity. That's what I bring.

### Craftsmanship
I care about doing things right. Sometimes too much — but I'd rather build something I'm proud of than ship something I'm not.

### Collaboration
I want to win with people, not despite them. The best work happens when you're pushing against someone good.

### Growth
Every role, every project, every setback — I come back with new skills and clearer understanding. That's the pattern I want to keep.

### Impact Over Activity
20 focused calls beats 80 spray-and-pray dials. Quality prospecting over volume metrics. Results should speak.

## Philosophy

### On Learning
> "Once I understood I could learn anything, accomplish anything, once I broke through that barrier, it opened up so many doors."

### On Approach
> "Give me the ability to hunt, cook, and clean my own food — I'll produce more than any SDR."

### On Creativity
> "Diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight."

### On The Commitment
> "Ship first. Buzzer-beater second."

## The Influences

### Dr. Adam Kiefer (Mentor)
- "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop."
- "You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."
- First to show me there are things I've done to be proud of

### Musical Philosophy
- Organized Noize / The Dungeon — Atlanta lineage
- Goodie Mob, Mobb Deep, Gang Starr, MF DOOM, Freddie Gibbs & Madlib
- Substance over polish. Authenticity over veneer.

### The IROC-Z Philosophy
- Full teardown and rebuild — frame off, body work, rust repair
- "You learn by taking things apart"
- Same approach to GTM systems

## What Doesn't Work For Me

> **Context for fit assessment, not complaints.**

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Pure activity metrics (80 calls/day) | I produce through quality, not volume |
| Complete isolation | I need engagement and collaboration to ship |
| Scripted/rigid execution | I suffocate without room to think and build |
| No path to growth | I want to prove I can level up, not just hop |
| Product I can't believe in | I can't fake enthusiasm |
