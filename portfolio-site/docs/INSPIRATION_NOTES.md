## What Stands Out

### 1. Loading Experience
- Sets the tone before you even arrive
- Builds anticipation
- **Our version:** Turntable loader with needle drop

### 2. Depth & Layering
- Overlapping elements create visual depth
- Things feel alive, not flat
- Multiple planes of content

### 3. Traveling Elements
- Little things moving across the site constantly
- Creates energy and life
- **On hover:** They stop completely — makes you want to click
- Interaction invites exploration

### 4. Big Transitions
- State changes that surprise you
- "Holy shit" moments
- Not subtle — intentional impact

### 5. Copy That Hits
- Titles feel important/powerful
- Favorite: "only selling what I truly believe in"
- Authentic, personal, no corporate speak
- **Apply to:** CTAs, bullets, headlines on lecturesfrom

### 6. Personality
- You see it and you're like "this is a real person"
- Truth-telling vibe
- "Live your truth like yourself"

## Apply to Lecturesfrom

### CTAs — Reframe
- Not "Contact Me" → something with conviction
- Not "View Projects" → something that reflects belief
- Every CTA should feel like Keegan talking

### Bullets — Reframe
- Not resume-speak
- First-person, honest, specific
- "First time I felt close to success..."
- "Built this because I believed..."

### Headlines — Reframe
- Current: "Career Timeline" → could be more powerful
- Current: "JD Fit Analyzer" → could have more personality
- Think: what would make someone stop scrolling?

## Mood

Authentic. Alive. Confident. Personal. Not trying to impress — just being real.
