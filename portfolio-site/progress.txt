COMPLETED:
- Single-page portfolio (app/page.tsx)
- Hero with SprayText animation (components/SprayText.tsx)
- Career timeline (components/Timeline.tsx)
- JD Analyzer with Firecrawl URL scraping (components/JDAnalyzer.tsx, app/api/jd-analyzer/route.ts)
- AI Chat via Supabase Edge Functions + Claude API (components/Chat.tsx, app/api/chat/route.ts)
- PostHog analytics (client + server)
- Marquee ticker (components/Marquee.tsx)
- Publications section (components/Publications.tsx, used inside Timeline)
- ActivityStream sidebar (components/ActivityStream.tsx)
- Vercel deployment with URL rewrites (vercel.json)
- Discogs "Recent Digs" banner widget (components/RecentDigs.tsx, app/api/discogs/route.ts)
- Canonical documentation: PRD.md, APP_FLOW.md, TECH_STACK.md, FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md, BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- DESIGN_PLAYBOOK.md content folded into FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md
- Page title updated to 'Keegan Moody | lecturesfrom' (LEC-25)
- Hero taglines updated to Set Q: Revenue systems / Useful in every room / Here for the long build (LEC-26)
- Footer: added Discord + Bluesky social links (LEC-27)
- Marquee: replaced fake data with real GitHub API via /api/github route (LEC-28)
- FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md synced to match actual component behavior (LEC-29)
- Supabase experiences: fixed dates (TraceAir, Chapel Hill), title (Barbour), enriched bullets (Mixmax, Biofourmis), added Mercer + EMT rows (LEC-30)
- Supabase MCP config fixed: project_ref and read_only flag corrected
- YouTube persistent player widget (Phase 1, Step 1.1) -- components/YouTubePlayer.tsx, types/youtube.d.ts
- GitHub activity widget (Phase 1, Step 1.2) -- components/GitHubActivity.tsx, app/api/github/route.ts
- Banner compaction (LEC-31): RecentDigs covers 250px→72px, GitHubActivity chart 48px→24px, YouTubePlayer tightened, all widgets py-2 with inline labels
- YouTubePlayer: fixed persistState stale closure (reads player.getPlayerState() instead of React state)
- YouTubePlayer: fixed Script deadlock (<Script> + hidden iframe now always render, skeleton is a ternary inside same return)

IN PROGRESS:
- Phase 2: Turntable loading experience (see TURNTABLE HANDOFF section below)

NEXT:
- Merge feature/banner-compact to main, verify live site via Vercel preview first
- Build MVP turntable on feature/turntable-loading branch
- Test via Vercel preview URL, then merge to main
- Worthy Reads widget (Phase 1, Step 1.3 -- data source TBD)
- Banner section layout (Phase 1, Step 1.4 -- design TBD in Aura)
- Alan Iverson chat persona (Phase 3) -- DEFERRED, moved to Backlog

--- TURNTABLE HANDOFF (Phase 2) ---

This section provides full context for any agent picking up the Turntable build.

GOAL: Entry experience at lecturesfrom.com/keeganmoody33. Visitor sees a turntable
loading page. They interact with it (drop the needle / click play). Music starts via
YouTube, then the portfolio loads with music continuing in the banner player.

WHAT EXISTS ALREADY:
- YouTubePlayer widget: components/YouTubePlayer.tsx
  - Loads YouTube IFrame API client-side via next/script
  - Hidden iframe, custom retro control bar
  - Playlist: PLK7yHtEENYGHUVVhW9oaFVKRhh-FORGOk
  - sessionStorage contract at key 'yt-player-state'
  - Persists: videoId, trackTitle, trackAuthor, position, duration, playing, playlistIndex, volume, timestamp
  - On mount, checks sessionStorage -- if playing=true and timestamp is fresh (<30s), resumes playback
- TypeScript types: types/youtube.d.ts (YT namespace declarations)
- Error boundary: WidgetErrorBoundary in app/page.tsx wraps all banner widgets

AUTOPLAY STRATEGY (CRITICAL):
- Browsers block audio autoplay UNLESS preceded by a user gesture (click/touch)
- The turntable needle drop IS the user gesture. User clicks/taps to drop the needle.
- This click event triggers player.playVideo() -- browser allows it because it's
  user-initiated. No autoplay workaround needed.
- Flow: user click -> playVideo() -> music starts -> transition to portfolio
- The banner YouTubePlayer reads sessionStorage on mount and continues playback

WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT:
1. Turntable page/component (MVP version for tonight, polish later in Aura)
   - Dark page, centered turntable visual or play interaction
   - Needle drop / click triggers YouTube playback
   - Writes to sessionStorage['yt-player-state'] with playing: true
   - Transition animation (fade/zoom) to portfolio
   - Skip button with clever copy (not "skip" -- something that makes user feel lame)
   - Return visitor bypass: check localStorage, skip to portfolio if visited before
   - prefers-reduced-motion: skip turntable entirely
2. Routing: turntable as entry point, portfolio loads after interaction
3. PostHog events: turntable_loaded, turntable_needle_dropped, turntable_skipped

SPEC: docs/TURNTABLE_LOADING_SPEC.md (full locked spec)
SESSION STORAGE KEY: 'yt-player-state' (match YouTubePlayer.tsx exactly)
LOCAL STORAGE KEY: 'lf-visited' (for return visitor bypass)

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
- Build on branch: feature/turntable-loading
- Push branch -> Vercel creates preview URL for testing
- Test preview URL on desktop + mobile
- Merge to main only when verified
- Rollback: git revert HEAD --no-edit && git push origin main

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Schema drift: multiple SQL files reference incorrect column names (see root-level SQL files)
- achievements table populated but not queried by any Edge Function
- Deno std lib in Edge Functions pinned to 0.168.0 (~45 versions behind)
- Most components lack dedicated mobile responsive handling (RecentDigs no longer has separate mobile/desktop variants -- unified compact layout)
- No ARIA labels on most interactive elements
- No rate limiting on API routes
- No caching on Discogs API route
- Activity Stream uses hardcoded/simulated data (not real-time)
- DISCOGS_TOKEN missing from .env.local.example

PARKING LOT (not in scope yet):
- Human/Machine toggle (Phase 5)
- Navigation pathways redesign (Phase 4)
- Vinyl grid overlay / Stack of Wax (Phase 4)
- Easter eggs (Konami code, hidden /practice route)
- Console.log personality messages
