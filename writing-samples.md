## Post 1: GTM Engineer School Announcement (LinkedIn, ~June 2025)

I've been experimenting with some new tools and thought I should share an update (or two) since I last mentioned the importance of learning new things.

Graduated Clay #cohort14 two weeks ago. A real salute to Yash Tekriwal & Arpit Choudhury for the intentionality and mindfulness as they continue to impress and inspire me w/ both nuance and scale

Hats off to them – no wonder they're driving revenue like they are when they focus on educating users so effectively and provide the means (and credits!) to practice.

Yesterday was the first day of GTM Engineer School (first cohort & only of its kind). Where I get to engage with legends like Zach Vidibor of Octave who have dedicated themselves to creating this very idea

The next 4 weeks I'll be utilizing platforms like Cargo, lemlist, Clay AirOps and Octave to upskill and my GTM engineering abilities, building rapidly on the readiness I already bring. – if you have questions reach out.

Anyways.

Y'all are toast.

## Post 2: Age of Imagination (LinkedIn, ~2mo prior)

Reading on the Information Age, I stumbled across a fascinating paper by Charlie Magee from 1993. He was already talking about what he called the "Age of Imagination,". Magee was one of the first to use this term, and his insights have made me realize that this new era is closer than we might think.

Magee made a point that really resonated with me:

> "From a security standpoint, the current communication tools have created a world in which it is increasingly difficult to separate the good guys from the bad guys in the global marketplace. In an Imagination Age it will be impossible..."

This got me thinking. As businesses streamline and automate, the real game-changer isn't just information or even intelligence – it's our ability to imagine, create, and never stop learning.

We're on the verge of a world where human experiences are front and center. Automation helps us get things done, but it also frees us up to innovate and create in ways we never thought possible.

This kind of future excites me – it's a world where creativity and imagination are the most valuable assets.

I attached the paper and would highly recommend! It's a lost gem.

** Learn how to learn if you haven't already **

*** Keep people at the heart of everything. ***

Seriously. Check it out and let me know what you think.

## Post 3: TraceAir Storm Water Webinar (LinkedIn, ~Dec 2024)

Words from the local legend Glenn Burns of Channel 2 Action News: 2-3 inches of rain before Wednesday this week in ATL.

I'll be busy diverting water in my basement. The recent hurricane made it feel like the entire storm parked over my house, and I toughed it out with a shop vac.

This week's storm isn't as extreme, but now I've got a plan if water shows up—

If you're dealing with delays from the rain or trying to get a head start on 2025 goals, check out the TraceAir Webinar on Storm Water Management.

Can't make it? No worries—let's talk shop. Trying to learn more about what's on the timeline for 2025. I might be able to connect some dots and share a specific impact I've seen TraceAir have on a job site.

## Post 4: TraceAir New Job Gratitude (LinkedIn, ~July 2024)

*930 impressions*

After parting ways w/ my 1st sales startup early 2023, I wasn't sure how long it would be before I found another sales role that tapped into my growing passion for collaboration, creativity, and understanding how strategy and sales collide. As 90 days flew by, I had to enroll in Hustle 101 and took on some jobs that will withstand the test of time: pressure washing, pushing carts at Home Depot, painted a single fence, office-to-office sales operations, HVAC install, and running food at KR Steak.

A modest guess would be 60 interviews, where i made it to the 4th connect in 8/60. Lots of one-time connects, plenty of awesome people, great ideas, and a handful of pyramid schemes. I stopped counting. Was I fumbling interviews, or not being transparent enough about my work gap? My dad gave me the advice, "be honest without regret" (keep things 💯) and things would be all good.

Forever, or over 500 days later, I'm waking up beyond grateful and appreciative for the opportunity I have at TraceAir Technologies. Today I am finishing my 3rd week, and I'm loving the energy, people, and challenges.

The word "Journey" is worn out and too dramatic for this context, that being said I'm thankful for the perspective shifts, new people, and experiences logged in real life. I'm feeling like the protagonist in this story and motivated to keep things pushing.

Major thanks, grammy-style to:
- **Tyler Combs** — For sharpening my skills at Biofourmis, always answering questions, and boosting me up last minute before an interview.
- **Adam Dansby** — For being genuine, sending me old school cars to buy despite price, and more importantly, encouraging me to ask myself tough questions about what I wanted from my peers, managers, and the companies I pursued. Specifically, helping me hone the knowledge of oneself.
- **Thomas Demetriades** — From onboarding as new hires to calling me up as a friend to grab lunch while traveling through ATL.
- **Jeff Thrutchley** — For sending me my first sales book back in 2021 and believing in me no matter what.
- **Josh Pappas** — For being the closest thing I have to a mentor in sales, and teaching me every time we speak about people within small & big business. More than anything just being a stand-up guy.
- **Caleb Hill** — For keeping my passion for business alive by asking tough questions after long shifts at work.
- **Auriell Towner** — For sending opportunities at lightning speed.
- **Myriah Towner** — For constructive feedback, encouragement, and wicked listening skills.
- **Gabriel Jones** — For providing his office for interviews when I needed it most.

Big thanks to **Corey Jordon** for seeing something in me others didn't & giving me the opportunity at TraceAir Technologies. I can't forget the team I initially connected with during interviews: Amber King, Tyler Cole, Hollie Zhivotovskiy, and Isaiah Lopez for being transparent, sincere people I wanted to work with day-to-day.

Recap: Thanks to everyone who showed love while I was on sabbatical.

I got a new job.
I'm feeling good. ✅

## Post 5: Analog Is Cool Again (LinkedIn, Aug 15)

Musically this resonates starting w/ subject line. . . I stepped away from the QWERTY keyboard, and mouse driven process music creation (like so many other processes) became.

Long story short I really turned my process upside down. Taking things back to fundamentals. Digging for records IN REAL LIFE, bring them home, Sampling into a stand alone drum machine manufactured in 1997, and man what a challenge. Movement, the groove, and feel are no longer goals but kind of a a given.

Having everything, is not always everything.

if you are struggling with anything process dependent, ask yourself "what would a set of limitations do for you? In the short term? Long term?"

I'm no guru. Shout to Jack Raines. Shout out to my 1987 Camaro with a dead battery right now.

Godspeed my people.

## Post 6: 30MPC Sponsorship Outreach Email (Sep 2, 2024)

**To:** nick@30mpc.com, armand@30mpc.com

Here you go boss:

**1. What is one account you think we'd want to sell a sponsorship to?**

Just to give you an idea of how I'm thinking.

If an account couldn't sponsor an entire episode of 30MPC, I'm not sure if they would be my number one priority. The followers and reputation of adding value at the end of the day is what has kept me in the loop with 30MPC. I'd hate to do business with a team that doesn't have a solution that can impact a listener (potentially).

I love —> https://www.clay.com/ and think what they are doing is fundamentally changing the game when it comes to enriching contacts, and so much more.

Other company's to target: (Y Combinator, Swif, Jotform, Domestika) there is plenty of opportunity. Another is https://8leads.io/

I'll stick with Clay for the example.

**2. Who are the target prospects we'd want to speak to at that account?**

Below I have dropped a collection of names I could dig into to really better understand if they were the right person.

**3. Draft 1 prospecting email that you'd send someone at that account (assume this is a cold email, not asking for a referral).**

**To:** Jax Lieu
**SUBJECT:**

Jax,

Been learning what feels like an illegal amount of strategy and process from you on LI...

So I looked a little deeper and saw you mention layoffs in 2018 to now leading growth at Swif; pioneering innovations with Clay is seriously inspiring. (Not too long ago I was pushing carts at Home Depot in ATL, GA)

Would love to talk origin stories, rock bottom(s) and big wins with you. I know it will resonate with our community at 30MPC.

You've been killing it with both Swif, Clay, now Brainalong w/ the (1UP revenue podcast) and thought the connection could inspire our respective communities together and bring them the newest thought processes and tools as of August 2024.

Would you be up for hanging out with us on an episode?

Let me know what you think.

Blessings,
