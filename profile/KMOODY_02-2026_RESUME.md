## Summary

GTM Engineer built across four technical companies — each one adding a layer to how I think about product, pipeline, and building. Co-founding SDR at Biofourmis (clinical AI, unicorn) is where it started: enterprise sales into hospitals, sitting in on product calls, giving feedback directly to engineers, learning data pipeline architecture from the CTO. That foundation shaped everything after. At TraceAir (construction intelligence), I built prospecting methodology from public permit data with no tools or playbook — greenfield territory, 147% attainment, all self-sourced. Mobb AI (application security) put me at the edge of AI tooling — adopted Anthropic's MCP the week it launched and built market intelligence from SEC regulatory data. At Mixmax (sales execution platform), I shipped a 9-agent agentic AI system, built internal apps, ran ETL pipelines in Python, and designed the full outbound infrastructure from zero as the sole GTM hire.

The through-line: I gravitate toward technical products, learn how they work, and build the go-to-market systems around them from first principles. I self-taught Next.js, Supabase, and Python to build an AI-powered portfolio site — not because it was required, but because I want to be a driving force in the product flywheel, not just the pipeline feeding it. Looking for a long-term home with elite teammates where I can grow, ship, and contribute to what gets built. Published researcher (2 Elsevier papers, Mercer University), first-gen college student, builder by default.
