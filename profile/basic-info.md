## Professional Identity

**What I Do:** GTM Engineer — I build the infrastructure that makes revenue machines work.

**The Headline:** Builder. Hunter. Finds diamonds in dirt.

**One-Line:** Scientist-trained, blue-collar roots, sampling mentality. I build GTM systems that produce results.

## The Positioning

I'm a GTM Engineer — the person in the lab with the whiteboard, engineering the pieces that feed the flywheel. Prospecting systems, outbound automation, ICP frameworks, campaign architecture.

Think of it like building a car: I design the transmission, the headers, the exhaust — the systems that make the engine run. Then I hand it to the people who drive it.

**What makes me different:**
- Scientist-trained (organic chemistry, published research, 270 days fieldwork)
- Blue-collar roots (first-gen college student, worked with my hands)
- Sampling mentality from hip-hop production (diamonds from dirt, constraint-driven creativity)

I see patterns others miss because I learned to work with limitations and find the signal in the noise.

## The Story Arc

1. **Scientist** → Trained in organic chemistry, 270 days fieldwork in Peru, 2 published papers
2. **Medical school pivot** → Got accepted (Miami), walked away after seeing healthcare business up close
3. **Startup grind** → Biofourmis (co-founding SDR, North America, Orlando Health deal) → Trace Air ($220K in 90 days, 23 demos first month)
4. **GTM infrastructure** → Mixmax (built complete outbound system from zero, first time doing any of it)
5. **The builder** → Portfolio site, JD analyzer, tools — teaching myself to build what I imagine
6. **What's next** → Founding GTM role. Product-adjacent. Elite teammates. Long-term growth.

## Personal Elements

### The IROC-Z
- 1987 Camaro IROC-Z, bought for $5k from Indiana
- Full teardown and rebuild — frame off, body work, rust repair
- "You learn by taking things apart" → same approach to GTM systems

### The Music
- Sample-based production, hip-hop
- Technics SL-1200 MK2 turntables (one signed by Slick Rick)
- MPC 2000 XL
- Philosophy: "Diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight."

### Camp Horizon
- Annual volunteer, foster children ages 8-12
- Only 1:1 camper-to-counselor ratio in the Southeast
- 4 years with same camper — "most influential male in this kid's life"

### Dr. Adam Kiefer (Mentor)
- "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop."
- Took me to South America for 270 days
- First to show me there are things to be proud of
