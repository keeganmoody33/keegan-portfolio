# Career Deep-Dive Interview: The Real Story

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Extract honest career context for portfolio and resume development  
**Format:** Raw interview synthesis — no polish, no LinkedIn speak

## Executive Summary: Who You Are

You're a scientist who walked away from medicine when you saw the machine up close. You're a builder who learns by taking things apart — cars, systems, sounds. You're a digger who finds what's hidden in plain sight. You're someone people invest in before you've proven anything — turntables, MPCs, contracts, opportunities — because they see something in you.

You've got 270 days of fieldwork in South American mines. You've spent a month of your life with a foster kid who has no one else. You originated a million-dollar deal at your first sales job. You booked 20 demos with 18 contacts you sourced yourself when everyone said the territory was dead.

You've also been fired three times. You've struggled with shipping, with optics, with communicating concisely. You've drowned in autonomy and suffocated without it.

**The commitment going forward:** Ship first. Buzzer-beater second.

## Part 1: The Career Timeline (Honest Version)

### The Medical School Pivot

**The polished version:** "I didn't get into medical school."

**The real version:** You got into medical school — University of Miami, late acceptance — and turned it down.

**What actually happened:**
- Took the MCAT twice
- 99th percentile on biochemistry and science sections
- Applied to 30+ schools, many late
- Got accepted to Miami on late admission

**Why you walked away:**

While waiting on med school decisions, you were working at Barbour Orthopedics. Front desk office associate — had keys, trained people, processed paperwork, handled patient intake.

What you saw:
- The office wouldn't accept insurance patients — only legal cases and pay-upfront
- Patients with injury cases (car accidents, etc.) would get inflated or extended treatment
- The goal was to deplete the case money
- Backroom deals with lawyers
- A scam with a stethoscope

Your role: You weren't designing the scheme, but you were in the room. The owner told you to keep your head down. You did. You got out when you could.

**The real reason you turned down Miami:**

> "I was turned off by the business aspect. I could impact the community in ways beyond delivery of care."

**How people reacted:** Nobody pushed back. People have always trusted your judgment.

**What it unlocked:**

> "My education showed me I wasn't really a super academic person before college. Once I understood I could learn anything, accomplish anything, once I broke through that barrier, it opened up so many doors."

This is also when you started making music — the first time you had bandwidth to develop hobbies and explore creatively.

### Biofourmis (First Startup, First Sales Job)

**Company:** Biofourmis Inc. — digital health company, remote patient monitoring, AI-driven therapeutics

**Role:** Co-founding SDR, Commercial Care vertical

**How you got in:** Applied cold on LinkedIn. Interviewed by Chief Commercial Officer Sheezah Hussain. Science background got their attention.

**What you actually did:**
- SDR work — generating leads, cold calling, sequenced emails in HubSpot
- ZoomInfo (new tool at the time), 500 emails out
- Essentially a GTM engineer before the title existed — free rein to build
- Highly technical involvement as software updated
- Met with CTO in Singapore, learned about Kafka buses, anonymizing medical IDs
- Within 8 months, company went from Series B/C to unicorn status

**What worked:**

> "Being super mindful. Persistent. Real reasons. Real value that Biofourmis was adding as the digital health corridor began to create itself."

Your process:
- Found hospitals over the federal limit for ER readmissions
- Identified the person responsible for that number (Director of Quality Assurance)
- Called them, asked how they were tackling it
- Introduced Biofourmis as the solution

**The big win: Orlando Health**

- You originated a deal that is still generating revenue today
- Estimated over $1 million in lifetime value
- Fastest deal they ever closed — 90 days max
- You didn't close it (AE Tyler Cole did), but the origin started with you

**Team growth:**
- By unicorn status, team had 2 more SDRs
- Weekly meetings, dashboards
- No reporting manager — you reported directly to CCO

**What was hard:**

> "Day to day discipline of working remote. Learning how to be a successful salesman. Learning sales stuff day to day."

**Your approach vs. expectations:**

- They expected 80 calls/day
- Your process was more personal — 20-40 focused, meaningful calls
- You led the team quarter over quarter in results
- But not in daily activity metrics

**The friction:**

> "The CCO did understand what it was like day to day as an SDR. There were no intermediate managers to bridge that gap."

**How it ended:** You got fired in January.

**The real reason:**

> "Pushing numbers without understanding how to refine quality over quantity."

The CCO left as well. Your mentor Josh Pappas (most tenured, director-level) was leaving too. Eventually they kept the person who was "most teacher's pet, gimmicky, follow the rules type."

**The lesson you took (but would fall short on later):**

> "Optics are everything. Sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy. Prove things with numbers. Learn to avoid friction at all costs."

---

### The Gap Period (January – June/July)

**What happened:** You couldn't find another opportunity like Biofourmis for 6+ months.

**What you did:**
- Worked at Home Depot pushing carts to pay rent
- Did contract work with Josh Pappas (ex-Biofourmis mentor)
- Helped Dr. Mike Blaney (bariatric surgeon in Augusta) with Bariatric Centers of America / BariNav
- Built GTM funnel, overall outbound process for hospital outreach and software piloting
- $299 contract work — experience, relationship, potential upside
- That project is still going; you still occasionally help

**The mindset:**

> "That was a hustle. I wanted to prosper. I was motivated to get a better opportunity, and I knew I had learned a lot of stuff."

**What you refused to do:**

> "Refused to get back into metrics-heavy, lack of autonomy roles where I'm just smiling and dialing."

---

### Trace Air (SDR Role)

**Company:** Trace Air — software/service for land development. Flies your project at set cadence, provides volume metrics, scheduling, insights on how land is being developed over time. Acquisition, land development, construction.

**How you got in:** Applied on LinkedIn after onboarding and interviews.

**The situation when you arrived:**
- Team of 3 SDRs — 2 were let go right when you got there
- Just you, another new hire (Jillian), and the SDR manager (Corey Jordan)
- Holly (best performer, still your friend) was crushing it, hitting quota (15 demos/month)
- The 2 who got let go weren't really trying

**The territory problem:**
- Greenfield territory
- No resources, no tools given internally
- Finite contacts in Salesforce — top 100 residential land developers, mass contact upload
- Your territory: ~2,200 contacts
- Another SDR's territory: ~8,800 contacts
- Same quota expectations, same call metrics

**What you built:**
- Started with LinkedIn — manually sending videos
- Leveraged ChatGPT to find active projects
- Searched for "next big developments within the next decade" in major cities
- Found who was running the development
- Called them, brought up their specific project, sparked interest
- Introduced Trace Air and how it could help

**The results:**
- Record month: 20 demos booked
- 18 of those contacts were NOT in their Salesforce — you sourced them yourself
- Top performer despite the territory disadvantage

**The friction:**

October — you were moving slower than your record September. Not on track to hit quota. Your SDR manager (Corey) sent an email tagging the VP of Sales. Not a PIP, but a warning. Nobody else got that email despite also not being on track.

You took a couple days to respond professionally.

**The call that changed everything:**

Later that month, team call. Holly mentioned grievances. Corey said: "It's not like your house is burning down."

You jumped in:

> "Yo man, I understand her house isn't burning, but I need leads. Jillian and I need leads. I'm not gonna hit quota if I don't have the tools necessary. It doesn't make sense if I'm working with a finite amount of contacts. Give me the ability to hunt, cook, and clean my own food — I'll produce more than any SDR. But if you're giving me finite contacts and questioning me about where I found contacts when they're not in Salesforce and we booked a demo, then I'm going to stand up for myself."

> "My house IS burning."

**What happened next:**
- Corey hopped off the call immediately
- He reached out to other team members, politicking, before ever reaching out to you
- Beginning of January, you were late or didn't show up to a meeting
- Next call was with HR — they fired you

**Despite being top performer. Despite 20 demos. Despite 18 contacts sourced yourself.**

**What Corey would probably say about you:**

> "I was not what they needed. He might say I'm talented. He might say I'm a slacker. He didn't like me and felt threatened. I was not trying to take his shine."

**Would you do it again?**

> "I would have done it again man. It needed to be done. But I would have probably done it a little more agile."

### Mixmax (Founding GTM Engineer)

**Company:** Mixmax — sales engagement platform. Stuck at Series B for a decade. Rebranded from mixmax.com to Mixmax AI in November.

**How you got in:**
- Paid for Go-To-Market Engineering School (first cohort, June)
- Previously did Clay Cohort #11
- CRO Heath Barnett was in the GTM Engineering course
- Stayed in touch, back-and-forth
- Got a 2-week trial contract — task was to run a campaign
- Campaign didn't drive a ton of revenue, but you worked well with the team
- Paid $7,500 for the 2 weeks
- Got a 3-month contract: October 1 – January 1, $30,000 ($5,000 every 2 weeks)

**What you owned:**
- Everything outbound
- The CRO had killed all outbound when he arrived a year prior
- You were responsible for all outbound generation, cold emails, infrastructure
- Setting up 50 inboxes, buying domains, Smartlead, Clay, Trigify
- Building Clay tables, workflows, campaigns, messaging, targeting, personas
- Full budget, full autonomy

**What actually happened:**

> "I didn't generate any revenue for them. I didn't get out near as many campaigns as I wanted."

**The timeline problem:**
- First month was infrastructure setup — inboxes, domains, systems
- Took longer than expected
- By the time you were hitting stride, contract got cut (December 12 — three weeks early)

**Where you got lost:**

> "I created this entire process, a value prop, a value offer. The initial message had to have something of value to offer. I was trying to generate these means of creating value. I was asking team members for ideas, for help. Nobody was giving me anything. They couldn't think of anything valuable."

> "I was building internal apps, trackers, all this stuff. Biting off way more than I could chew. Communicating to get help but people weren't buying into what I was doing."

> "They would pivot and say 'let's just do this.' And I'm like, man, I just spent three weeks on this framework. A lot of wasted time."

**The deliverable gap:**

On the closing call, Heath asked you to deliver three campaigns (Group A, B, C) — approximately 9,000 contacts (3,000 per campaign). You delivered ~3,770 total across all three.

**What you sent after:**
- A thorough "how to fix it" document to RevOps
- Breakdown/SOP showing where the bug was in your process
- How to fix it, how you'd do it in the future, troubleshooting

**The payment situation:**
- Contract was $30k over 3 months
- Pay discrepancy arose — invoices from the 2-week trial got counted
- You'd only received $10k at the time things ended
- Heath held final payment until campaigns were completed
- You worked 12 days in December without shipping what was asked
- You requested prorated payment (~$3,800) for December work
- Final message from Heath: "Please keep all communication going forward over email."

**What Heath would probably say (honest assessment):**

> "He's talented. Creative. Genuinely wants to do great work. But he struggled with execution — he'd spend weeks building the perfect framework when I needed campaigns out the door. Organization wasn't his strength. He didn't deliver what we agreed on by the deadline we set. That said — he owned it at the end. Didn't make excuses. Asked for feedback. If you hire him, make sure you give him clear deadlines, check-ins, and someone to keep him accountable. The raw talent is there. The systems aren't yet."

**Your own assessment:**

> "I'm not happy with my performance. I'm being a little hard on myself, but given my experience now, I would move a lot faster and more agile. When you're unsure of these systems, doing this stuff for the first time, it takes longer. Speed was not my strong suit. But I was grinding dude. I was absolutely going so hard."

**What you'd do differently:**

> "Not worry about perfection. Not worry about creativity. Do what was suggested or expected initially just to get campaigns out. Churn out campaigns. Let those numbers speak. Instead of doing the big half-court buzzer-beater shot that blows everybody away."

## Part 2: The Patterns

### Pattern 1: Top Performer, Still Fired

**Biofourmis:** Led the team in results quarter over quarter. Originated million-dollar deal. Fired for not hitting daily activity metrics.

**Trace Air:** 20 demos in one month. 18 contacts sourced yourself. Top performer. Fired after standing up for your team and missing a meeting.

### Pattern 2: Autonomy Paradox

**Too little autonomy:** Biofourmis and Trace Air — metrics-heavy, no room to work your way. Suffocated.

**Too much autonomy:** Mixmax — full ownership, no guardrails. Drowned.

**What you actually need:** Autonomy with guardrails. Clear, time-bound deliverables. Someone engaged enough to give feedback and check-ins, but not micromanaging.

### Pattern 3: Builder vs. Shipper

You're wired to strip it down and rebuild it right. But sometimes the job is just to get it running.

- **IROC-Z:** Full teardown, frame off, body work, rust repair, rebuilt from ground up
- **Mixmax:** Full system build — frameworks, value props, internal tools — but campaigns didn't ship

**The car metaphor:** You were rebuilding the engine when they needed you to just drive.

### Pattern 4: Optics Problem

> "The real lesson, which I still would fall short on later in my career, was optics are everything. You know you're doing the right thing, but sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy. Prove things with numbers."

You knew this lesson after Biofourmis. You still made the same mistake at Trace Air (standing up in the call) and Mixmax (building frameworks instead of shipping visible work).

### Pattern 5: Communication Gap

> "I struggle with communicating my ideas effectively in a concise, clear way sometimes if I'm riffing."

At Mixmax, Heath was overwhelmed and didn't have bandwidth for your ideas. At Trace Air, Corey felt threatened. The pattern: people don't get what you're doing, and by the time you explain it, trust is eroded.

### Pattern 6: People Invest in You

- **Marketplace guy:** Fronted you Technics turntables (one signed by Slick Rick) on a payment plan
- **Uber driver:** Shipped you a $1,000 MPC 2000 XL just because
- **Heath:** Gave you the "opportunity of a lifetime" after meeting you in a course
- **Josh Pappas:** Brought you into side projects
- **Dr. Kiefer:** Took you to South America for 270 days of fieldwork

That's not luck. Something about you makes people want to bet on you. They see the potential. They want to be part of what you're building.

---

## Part 3: What You Actually Need

**The right environment:**
- Autonomy with guardrails — not "do whatever" and not "hit 80 calls or else"
- Someone engaged enough to give feedback and check-ins, but not micromanaging
- Clear, time-bound deliverables so you don't disappear into framework-building
- A partner or senior who can translate your ideas when you're riffing too fast
- A creative team with someone elite to learn from — a mentor

**What you need to fix:**
- Ship before it's perfect. Ugly and live beats beautiful and stuck in Clay
- Optics. You can be right and still lose if you don't manage perception
- Concise communication. If people don't get it, it doesn't matter how good the idea is
- Dependability. Say what you'll do. Do it when you said. Every time.

---

## Part 4: The Commitment

**The new operating principle:**

> "Ship first. Buzzer-beater second."

**What that means in practice:**

> "I'm not gonna wait for someone to create or provide a standard for communication and expectations. I'm going to be proactive. After the first week — not even the first week — I'm going to ship and deliver. Optics into what I'm doing. Not what I'm thinking, not what I'm brainstorming, not what I'm really excited about — but what I'm DOING to accelerate the business. I'm going to focus on shipping those expectations no matter what, perfect or not perfect, as a priority. Instead of prioritizing the big half-court buzzer-beater shot that blows everybody away. That has to be Plan B."

---

## Part 5: The Personal Foundation

### The IROC-Z

**The car:** 1987 Camaro IROC-Z. Third-gen, T-tops.

**How you got it:** Bought for $5k, shipped from Indiana. Saw it in the opening scene of "Hell or High Water" — bank robbers in Texas driving an IROC-Z. Just sold your vehicle, was ready to buy.

**What you did to it:**
- Blew the transmission within first month or two — rebuilt at AAMCO
- Wrecked it, messed up the bumper
- Stripped the entire car
- Fiberglassed the bumper
- Sanded, body work, got it ready for prime
- Pulled the stereo, sound-deadened the interior
- Replaced fuel pump, alternator
- Tightened struts
- Cleaned all the tar off (from northern town)
- Took off entire front frame, fenders
- Spotted and addressed all rust issues
- Rebuilt from ground up

**In hindsight:** Wouldn't buy that car again — 80s has too much plastic on the interior, cracks and breaks.

**What it reveals:** You learn by taking things apart. Same with GTM systems. Same with music.

---

### The Music

**Philosophy:**

> "Digging means something to me. Finding something that a ton of people have heard, or haven't heard, but somehow it's made its way to wax — and finding something there that no one's found. Hidden in plain sight."

> "Diamonds from dirt. Challenging yourself with limitations. Letting something inspire you enough to create another song — and you can't even identify where the sample is, but it's so nuanced or elegantly placed or powerful that you can't imagine the track without that inspiration."

> "It takes more than me to create music. It takes other people — the people that made the records before me, that I'm digging, that I'm sampling, that inspire me."

**On sitting with music:**

> "When things sit with you, you listen, you hear things differently. Lyrics appear differently. Timeless music is timeless. You can listen to it a million times and hear something for the first time."

**The collection (records that mean something):**
- 1965 Thelonious Monk — Bremen Germany Live (most expensive, newest record)
- Sly and the Family Stone
- Janis Joplin
- Isaac Hayes
- Goodie Mob (super important)
- Freddie Gibbs & Madlib
- MF DOOM
- Gang Starr (early 90s East Coast)
- Mobb Deep

> "My collection speaks to the explorer I am and the open mind I have."

**The gear:**
- Two Technics SL-1200 MK2 turntables (one signed by Slick Rick — fronted from Marketplace guy on payment plan)
- MPC 2000 XL (gifted by Uber driver, shipped to your house, $1,000)
- Old school Korg synthesizer (~$50)

**The process:**
- Sample-based production
- Take something from the turntable, put it in the MPC, sit with it, try to flip it
- Rapping, producing, both — whatever gets to the finish line

**What you make:**
- Started with light superficial rap over tight beats
- Transitioned to hardware — MPC standalone, then turntables
- Never released anything
- Got projects and ideas you've fiddled with

**Why you haven't released:**

> "Perfectionism is a portion of it. But it's a lot of learning too. It's an oversaturated market. I'm not worried about what others think. I trust my taste."

> "I'm not interested in releasing eight singles that have no meaning or aren't tied together. I want to release a project that can be put on wax and be here forever."

**Music and the portfolio:** Separate. Personal. Stays in the lab until it's right.

---

### The Influences

**Organized Noize / The Dungeon:**

Atlanta lineage — Outkast, Goodie Mob, the Dungeon Family sound. 90s hip-hop culture shapes how you think: rhythm, flow, precision, authenticity.

**What it represents:**

> "Substance over polish. Authenticity over veneer."

**Geographic influence on sound:**

> "This is how people created their own sound. Selecting records they wanted to hear and sampling that. Geographic location influencing what was in the record store."

---

## Part 6: Formative Experiences

### Mercury Research in South America

**The work:**
- 270 total days in South America
- Portable spectrophotometer (Ohio Lumex) measuring elemental mercury vapor concentrations
- Research on ASGM — Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining

**The process being studied:**
- Miners take ore, dump elemental liquid mercury on it
- Forms an amalgam, solidifies
- They burn it off with aerosolized gasoline
- Mercury burns off due to difference in boiling points
- Now bound in the air — people inhale it
- Creates Mercury Minamata disease ("mad as a hatter")

**What you actually did:**
- Walked miles through cities with the Ohio Lumex and a computer
- Created heat maps showing harmful areas
- Paired the Lumex with a Garmin GPS — both set to exact same time to the second
- Matched concentration readings with longitude/latitude
- Worked up data in Excel — VLOOKUPs, concatenations
- Long nights where one space could break everything

**The goal:**

> "Not be the white guy that comes in and tells you you're doing things wrong. But to find an alternative method for purification of gold that they were building their economy on."

**Locations:**
- Hostel to hostel through sketchy areas
- Non-Spanish speakers navigating alone
- Juan Cavallico — 14,000 feet, cinnabar mines
- Community of Saxo Marca (fell victim to Shining Path communist regime)

**Published papers from this work.**

---

### Dr. Adam Kiefer (Mentor)

**Who he is:** Young guy from Newark, New Jersey. Your organic chemistry mentor. Took you to South America.

**What he taught you:**

> "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop. You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."

**What he gave you:**
- The opportunity (asked you to go on the trip)
- Time together — just the two of you, roughing it
- Showed you there are things to be proud of

**On pride:**

> "He taught me there are things I've done and experiences to be proud of. I still struggle with that. I'm not really proud of a lot of what I've done. I'm just not a prideful person."

**The academic breakthrough:**

First time you ever got a good grade on an organic chemistry test — class of 80, you got 105. Only person over 90. Changed half your answers in the last 10 minutes.

After that, went on a streak where you didn't get any question wrong in any course.

> "It empowered me and showed me: dude, if you put in the work, you can learn anything."

**The trap that creates:**

> "Sometimes I can be too thorough, too detail-oriented. Too much blood, sweat, and tears on something I know I can eventually learn to get perfect. Because that's what it taught me — grinding in the library, late nights."

**On academia:**

> "People in academia are not going to receive everything well. It's very political. He was the political break — the funny guy, cusses, smokes cigarettes. Just a goat."

---

### Camp Horizon

**What it is:** Organization working with social services in Fulton and DeKalb County, Georgia. Serves foster children ages 8-12 (now also teenagers).

**What makes it unique:** Only 1:1 camper-to-counselor ratio in the Southeast.

**Your involvement:**
- Serve at camp every year
- Paired with a child for the entire week
- Sleep in same bunk bed
- Had the same camper for four years straight — spent a full month total with someone who doesn't have parents

> "I could be the most influential male in this kid's life."

**What it taught you:**

> "A lot of people talk about and complain about the community and what they want to see done. Very few are actually out there trying to impact change. Putting in the work and time it takes to change different generations. Being patient. Giving people time."

---

### Teaching and Coaching

- Taught special education
- Coached high school football
- Both during gap year (was supposed to be pre-med school)

---

## Part 7: The Name — Lectures From

**Origin:** Inspired by "Lectures on Gas Theory" by Ludwig Boltzmann.

**What it represents:**
- Statistical mechanics
- Entropy
- The behavior of systems at scale

> "Still love science. The name reflects that."

**What you do with it:**
- Portfolio/publishing house for technical and creative projects
- "An operator, creative force at the inseam of science, tech, and art"
- Approximately 35 projects spanning SaaS platforms, creative tools, and research

---

## Part 8: Key Quotes (In Your Own Words)

### On Learning

> "Once I understood I could learn anything, accomplish anything, once I broke through that barrier, it opened up so many doors."

> "If you put in the work, you can learn anything."

### On the Medical Pivot

> "I was turned off by the business aspect. I could impact the community in ways beyond delivery of care."

### On Sales Approach

> "What worked was being personal on the phone. Being genuine. Having a real reason for the call."

> "Give me the ability to hunt, cook, and clean my own food — I'll produce more than any SDR."

### On Optics

> "Optics are everything. Sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy. Prove things with numbers."

### On Mixmax

> "I'm not happy with my performance. Given my experience now, I would move a lot faster. Speed was not my strong suit. But I was grinding dude."

### On Shipping

> "I'm not gonna wait for someone to create or provide a standard for communication and expectations. I'm going to be proactive. I'm going to ship and deliver. Not what I'm thinking, not what I'm brainstorming — but what I'm DOING to accelerate the business."

### On Music

> "Digging means something to me. Finding something hidden in plain sight. Diamonds from dirt. Challenging yourself with limitations."

> "I want to release a project that can be put on wax and be here forever."

### On Responsibility

### On the Commitment

> "Ship first. Buzzer-beater second."

---

## Part 9: The Assessment

### Strengths

- **Pattern recognition:** Find what's hidden in plain sight — hospital readmission rates, land development projects, samples in records
- **Origination:** Create deals and opportunities from nothing (Orlando Health, 18 self-sourced contacts at Trace Air)
- **Technical learning:** Can learn anything with enough time and effort
- **System building:** Build frameworks, processes, infrastructure from scratch
- **Relationship building:** People invest in you before you've proven anything
- **Authenticity:** Won't fake it, won't play politics, won't compromise integrity
- **Resilience:** Home Depot carts to founding GTM engineer

### Growth Areas

- **Shipping speed:** Perfectionism slows delivery
- **Optics management:** Being right isn't enough if people don't see it
- **Concise communication:** Ideas get lost when riffing
- **Dependability:** Say what you'll do, do it when you said
- **Autonomy calibration:** Need guardrails, not free rein

### Ideal Environment

- Product you believe in
- Engaged leader/mentor who has time for you
- Creative team with someone elite to learn from
- Clear, time-bound deliverables
- Autonomy with check-ins
- Long-term opportunity to level up and prove growth

### What You Want

1. Long-term role where you can level up, get promoted, prove growth
2. Or: Build Lectures From into something that generates revenue
3. A product you believe in
4. A creative team with someone elite to learn from — a mentor

---

## Part 10: For the Portfolio

### The Narrative (Honest Version)

You were trained as a scientist, got into medical school, and walked away when you saw the machine up close. You pivoted into startups with no playbook, originated a million-dollar deal at your first sales job, and got fired anyway because you didn't play the metrics game. You pushed carts at Home Depot to pay rent while doing consulting on the side. You came back, crushed it at Trace Air — 20 demos in a month, 18 from contacts you sourced yourself — and got fired again after standing up for your team. Then you got the opportunity of a lifetime at Mixmax, had full autonomy, and learned its limits. You built frameworks instead of shipping campaigns. The contract ended early.

But you owned it. Asked for feedback. Committed to something different.

**Ship first. Buzzer-beater second.**

### The Proof Points

- **Orlando Health deal:** Originated as SDR, still generating revenue, estimated $1M+ lifetime value
- **Trace Air record month:** 20 demos, 18 contacts self-sourced, greenfield territory with 1/4 the contacts of peers
- **Mercury research:** 270 days fieldwork, published papers, built methodology from scratch
- **Camp Horizon:** 4 years with same foster child, 1:1 ratio, most influential male figure
- **IROC-Z:** Full teardown and rebuild — learning by taking apart

### The Differentiator

> "An operator, creative force at the inseam of science, tech, and art."

Scientific rigor. GTM execution. Creative authenticity. Builder mentality.

*End of Interview Synthesis*
