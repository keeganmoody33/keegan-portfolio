# Resume Methodology — Keegan Moody

**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Purpose:** Playbook for writing and updating resume bullets across all roles. Use this methodology in any future session that touches resume content.

## Core Principle: Connect the Dots

Don't describe tasks. Surface the **JD-level category** that each accomplishment falls under. Hiring managers and ATS systems scan for umbrella keywords, not the specifics of what you did.

**Wrong:** "Analyzed 280 customer accounts to understand revenue distribution"
**Right:** "Built ETL pipelines and structured datasets from raw customer data (280 accounts, $4.79M ARR) — segmented by firmographic, technographic, and behavioral signals to validate ICP"

The second version hits: ETL, datasets, data engineering, firmographic, technographic, ICP validation — all terms that appear in JDs.

## The Process

### 1. Read Target JDs First
Pull language directly from the roles you're applying to. Map what they ask for to what you did. The JDs we calibrated against (Feb 2026):

**Vercel:** GTM Engineer, AI Engineer, Product Engineer, Sales Engineer, Content Engineer, Commercial AE, Design Engineer
**PostHog:** Product Engineer
**YC Startups:** Assembly, Unusual, Cardinal, Persana AI, Paradigm, Unbound

### 2. Identify the Universal Keywords
These appeared across nearly every JD we analyzed:

| Keyword | What It Signals |
|---|---|
| 0-to-1 / greenfield | Built something from nothing |
| full ownership / autonomy / high agency | Operated independently, made decisions |
| agentic AI / AI-native | Built with AI, not just used AI |
| shipped / ship | Delivered production-ready work |
| first principles | Designed systems, didn't run playbooks |
| cross-functional | Worked across teams (product, engineering, marketing, sales) |
| experimentation / A/B testing | Tested hypotheses, iterated on data |
| pipeline generation | Created revenue opportunities |
| infrastructure / systems | Built repeatable processes, not one-off tasks |
| documentation / writing | Communicated clearly, enabled handoff |
| full-stack | Works across technologies and layers |
| prompt engineering / orchestration | Designed AI systems with intentionality |
| ETL / datasets / evaluation pipelines | Structured data for decision-making |

### 3. Frame as Builder, Not Executor
Lead with verbs that signal ownership and technical depth:
- **Use:** Built, shipped, architected, designed, originated, evaluated, selected, integrated, pioneered
- **Avoid:** Managed, assisted, supported, helped, contributed to, was responsible for

### 4. Show the Operational Intensity
Don't just describe the system — show you ran it at volume. Include daily/weekly/monthly activity metrics alongside the strategic work. This proves you're an operator, not just an architect.

### 5. Include Company Context
Format: **Company Name** | website | Industry descriptor — 1-2 sentence description of what the company does using their own public language. Include funding stage, notable clients, or key metrics where relevant.

## Cross-Role Pattern to Surface

Keegan has a repeatable, transferable skill: **turning public and regulatory data into pipeline targeting methodology.**

| Role | Public Data Source | What It Became |
|---|---|---|
| Biofourmis | CMS readmission penalty data | Hospital targeting by regulatory urgency |
| TraceAir | Land development permits & planning data | Decision-maker mapping for greenfield projects |
| Mobb AI | SEC filings, comment letters, material weaknesses | Pre-IPO compliance urgency scoring |
| Mixmax | Customer ARR data, case studies, tech stack signals | ICP validation and segmentation |

This pattern should be named and surfaced on the resume — either in a summary line or skills section.

## Audience Calibration

The same experience can be tuned for different audiences:

**Vercel-tier (established, technical):** Emphasize AI systems, prompt engineering, evaluation pipelines, full-stack depth, infrastructure at scale
**PostHog-style (builder culture):** Emphasize shipping fast, 0-to-1, genuine builder identity, documentation, extreme autonomy
**YC seed/Series A (scrappy startup):** Emphasize first principles, designing systems over running playbooks, intersection of engineering/product/growth, founder collaboration, high agency

## Tone Rules

- Technical & builder: reads like someone who ships infrastructure, not someone who "supported" a team
- Operator & ownership: every bullet starts from a position of authority and decision-making
- Direct, not corporate: "Killed underperformers fast, scaled what worked" not "Optimized campaign performance through iterative testing"
- Quantify where possible: $216K pipeline, 147% attainment, 21% connect rate, 280 accounts, 53 inboxes
