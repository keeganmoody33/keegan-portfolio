# KEY QUOTES IN YOUR OWN WORDS
## Direct Language From the Career Interview

---

# ON WORK PHILOSOPHY

## The Core Commitment
> "Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect."

## On Optics vs. Results
> "Optics are everything."

## On the MixMax Experience
> "I had full autonomy and I drowned in it."

> "Different from the other situations. At Biofourmis Inc. and Trace Air, I was fired for politics despite top performance. At MixMax, I had full autonomy and didn't deliver. That's on me."

## On Quality vs. Speed

## On Trace Air
> "Stood up for the team and got knocked down for it."

# ON MUSIC & DIGGING

## The Digging Philosophy
> "Finding something that a ton of people have heard — or have heard but somehow it's made its way to wax — and finding something there that no one's found. It's been hidden in plain sight."

> "Diamonds from dirt. Challenging yourself with limitations."

## On the Collection
> "My collection speaks to the explorer I am and the open mind I have when I'm thinking about something. There's always something there, man — it wasn't put on wax for no reason. Somebody thought it was important."

## On Collaboration
> "It takes more than me to create music... it takes the people that made the records before me."

## On Timeless Music
> "Timeless music is timeless. You can listen to it a million times and hear something for the first time — or the thousandth time — that you've never heard before."

## On Not Releasing Music Yet
> "I'm not interested in releasing eight singles that have no meaning or aren't tied together or aren't part of a cohesive project. I want to release a project that can be put on wax and be here forever."

> "I would hate to put something out that wasn't an actual representation of me at the time."

> "I'm not worried about what others think... I know that in order to be great you have to have great taste, and that taste is everything, and I trust my taste."

# ON THE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH

## The Approach

---

# ON THE BARBOUR ORTHOPEDICS EXPERIENCE

## What It Taught

# ON VIDEO MESSAGING

## The Philosophy
