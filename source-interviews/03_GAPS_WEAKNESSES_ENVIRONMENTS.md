# WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO

## Hard No's (Even If I Could Learn, I Don't Want To)

### Smile-and-Dial / Pure Metrics-Driven SDR
- **Refused this during gap period**: "Refused to get back into metrics heavy, lack of autonomy roles where I'm just smiling and dialing"
- **Why**: I know my approach works — quality over quantity. I won't sacrifice that for activity theater
- **Pattern**: This is what got me fired at Biofourmis Inc., but I was right about the approach
- **Implication**: Don't hire me for 80-calls-per-day expectations

### Work for Companies Doing Grimy Stuff
- **Learned this at Barbour Orthopedics**: Seeing the business side of healthcare turned me sour
- **Why**: I need to believe in what I'm selling
- **Pattern**: I walked away from medicine partly because of what I saw in that business
- **Implication**: Don't hire me to sell something I can't stand behind

### Work Under Threatened/Insecure Managers
- **Pattern at Trace Air**: Manager felt threatened, politicked against me, fired me despite being top performer
- **Why**: I'm not trying to take anyone's shine — I just want tools to do my job
- **Reality**: I need managers who are secure enough to let me perform
- **Implication**: I need to vet managers as much as they vet me

### Pure Corporate Political Games
- **Pattern across multiple roles**: I don't instinctively play politics
- **Why**: It feels inauthentic, and I've tried to improve but keep falling into the same traps
- **Growth area**: I'm working on optics management, but I don't want to become a politician
- **Implication**: Don't hire me for roles where political navigation is the primary skill

### Work Without Any Autonomy
- **Pattern at Biofourmis Inc.**: Micromanaged on call metrics despite leading in results
- **Why**: My best work comes when I can find my own angles, not follow a rigid script
- **Implication**: Don't hire me for roles where every action is prescribed

### Short-Term Contract Churn
- **What I want**: Long-term role where I can level up, get promoted, prove growth
- **Why**: "I've never really leveled up within a company before" — I want to change that
- **Implication**: Prioritize full-time or long-term contract opportunities

# ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I'D STRUGGLE

## High-Risk Situations for Me

### 1. Full Autonomy With No Check-Ins
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- MixMax proved this: "I had full autonomy and I drowned in it"
- I'll build frameworks instead of shipping campaigns
- I'll look for the perfect sample when the job is to press play
- I need someone to say "ship it ugly and iterate"

**What Happened**:
- Spent weeks on elaborate value propositions
- Built internal apps and trackers beyond scope
- Didn't complete the deliverables by deadline
- Contract ended early

**What I Actually Need**:
- Autonomy with guardrails
- Clear, time-bound deliverables
- Regular check-ins (weekly minimum)
- Someone who will tell me when to stop building and start shipping

### 2. Pure Metrics/Activity-Driven Culture
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- My approach is quality over quantity
- I produce elite results with 20-40 focused calls, not 80 random dials
- I've been fired twice for not hitting activity metrics despite leading in results

**What Happened**:
- Biofourmis Inc.: 80 calls expected, I did 20-40, got fired despite million-dollar deal
- Trace Air: Record month with 20 demos, still questioned about methodology

**What I Actually Need**:
- Culture that values outcomes over activity
- Leadership that understands different approaches can work
- Metrics that measure results, not just effort

### 3. Absent/Overwhelmed Leadership
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- I struggle with self-direction when there's no feedback loop
- I need engaged leadership with bandwidth for check-ins

**What Happened at MixMax**:
- CRO was overwhelmed, didn't have time for regular engagement
- Without feedback, I went deeper into framework-building
- Communication gap widened until contract ended

**What I Actually Need**:
- Manager with actual bandwidth for me
- Regular 1:1s with substantive feedback
- Someone who will push back on my ideas when needed

### 4. Hostile/Threatened Managers
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- I don't instinctively navigate political situations
- I will stand up for my team and myself
- Insecure managers will see this as a threat

**What Happened at Trace Air**:
- Stood up for team in a meeting about tools/resources
- Manager hopped off call immediately
- He politicked against me to every team member
- Got fired for being late to one meeting despite record month

**What I Actually Need**:
- Secure, confident leadership
- Manager who welcomes input (even pushback)
- Environment where speaking up is valued, not punished

### 5. Companies Not Actually Committed to Their Approach
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- I invest deeply in building systems the "right" way
- If the company pivots or wasn't truly committed, my work gets scrapped

**What Happened at MixMax**:
- Company had been stuck at Series B for a decade
- Rebranded to AI but wasn't fully committed to GTM engineering
- My frameworks got scrapped ("let's just do this simpler thing")

**What I Actually Need**:
- Company genuinely committed to GTM engineering approach
- Leadership that understands the timeline for proper implementation
- Patience for systems to mature

### 6. Roles Requiring Constant Context-Switching
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- I go deep, not wide
- I need time to sit with problems
- Like music: "Nothing's going to sit with you quite like something that's been in rotation for a couple of days or weeks"

**What I Actually Need**:
- Focus time for deep work
- Not being pulled into 10 different directions
- Space to think and build properly

### 7. Environments Where I Can't Learn
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- "I can get bored if I'm not learning new things"
- "The monotony can kind of get to me"
- Need dynamic environment with growth opportunities

**What I Actually Need**:
- Role with learning curve
- Mentor or senior to learn from
- New challenges regularly

### 8. Remote-Only Without External Structure
**Why This Is Dangerous For Me**:
- "I struggled with the day to day discipline of working remote life"
- Listed as weakness at Biofourmis Inc., still present at MixMax

**What I Actually Need**:
- External accountability structures
- Regular check-ins
- Potentially hybrid environment or co-working space
- Team interactions to break isolation

# FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

## Pattern 1: "Rebuilding the Engine When They Need Me to Drive the Car"
- **Shows up when**: Given too much freedom, unclear deliverables
- **Warning signs**: Spending time on frameworks, internal tools, "perfect" processes
- **Mitigation**: Clear deadlines, weekly deliverable check-ins, "ship ugly" reminders

## Pattern 2: "Standing Up and Getting Knocked Down"
- **Shows up when**: I see dysfunction and speak up
- **Warning signs**: Confrontation in meetings, pushing back on leadership publicly
- **Mitigation**: Build relationships first, raise issues privately, pick battles carefully

## Pattern 3: "Quality Over Quantity Becoming an Excuse"
- **Shows up when**: My approach is different from company expectations
- **Warning signs**: Missing activity metrics, not documenting my methodology
- **Mitigation**: Proactively communicate approach, show results alongside activity

## Pattern 4: "Communication Going Over Heads"
- **Shows up when**: Riffing, brainstorming, explaining complex ideas
- **Warning signs**: People looking confused, not getting buy-in, ideas dismissed
- **Mitigation**: Prepare communication, have partner to translate, be concise

## Pattern 5: "Letting Perfectionism Delay Shipping"
- **Shows up when**: Building something I care about
- **Warning signs**: Extending timelines, asking for "one more week," polishing instead of launching
- **Mitigation**: "Ship first, deliver before it's perfect" as operating principle

# RED FLAGS I SHOULD WATCH FOR IN OPPORTUNITIES

## Immediate Disqualifiers
1. Company with no clear product-market fit (will pivot constantly)
2. Manager who seems threatened or defensive in interviews
3. "We need 80 calls per day" mentioned without nuance
4. No one senior to learn from
5. "You'll be completely on your own" as a selling point
6. Short-term contract with no path to long-term
7. Company selling something I can't stand behind

## Yellow Flags (Proceed With Caution)
1. "We want a self-starter who doesn't need much direction" (might mean absent leadership)
2. "Fast-paced environment" (might mean chaotic, no focus)
3. "We're pivoting to AI" (might not be truly committed)
4. "The last person in this role didn't work out" (might be management problem)
5. "We want you to build everything from scratch" (might be code for no support)

## Questions I Need to Ask
1. "What does success look like in the first 90 days — specifically?"
2. "How often will I meet with my manager for feedback?"
3. "What's your philosophy on activity metrics vs. outcome metrics?"
4. "How long has this GTM approach been in place, and is leadership committed to it?"
5. "What happened to the last person in this role?"
6. "Is there someone senior I can learn from?"
7. "What's the path from this role to something long-term?"

# HONEST SELF-ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

## My Biggest Weakness
**Shipping speed and execution discipline.** I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume. At MixMax, I had everything — autonomy, budget, the dream setup — and I still didn't deliver because I was building instead of shipping.

## My Most Consistent Pattern
**Being right but still losing.** I've been top performer at two companies and still got fired. I've produced results that prove my approach works, but I didn't manage the optics. Being right doesn't protect you if the wrong person feels threatened.

## What I'm Actively Working On
1. "Ship first, deliver before it's perfect" — new operating principle
2. Proactive communication about what I'm DOING (not thinking)
3. Being dependable — saying what I'll do and doing it
4. Picking battles, building relationships before pushing back
5. Concise communication, especially when riffing

## What I Need Others to Know
I'm not a traditional employee. I'm a builder who needs a co-pilot. The best setup for me is autonomy with guardrails, a mentor with bandwidth, and clear deadlines. Left alone, I'll build forever. Micromanaged, I'll suffocate. The sweet spot is in between — and finding that fit is my biggest priority.
