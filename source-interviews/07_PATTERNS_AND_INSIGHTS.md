# PATTERNS, THEMES & INSIGHTS
## The Synthesis of Who I Am and How I Operate

# THE CORE PATTERNS

## Pattern 1: Top Performer Who Gets Fired

### The Evidence
- **Biofourmis Inc.**: Originated Orlando Health deal ($1M+ revenue, still active), led team in results. **Fired** for not hitting 80 calls/day metric.
- **Trace Air**: Record 20 demos in one month (18 self-sourced from outside the CRM). **Fired** after standing up for the team and being late to a meeting.

### The Diagnosis
"Being right but still losing."

Results prove the approach works, but results aren't enough:
- Activity metrics matter even when outcomes are strong
- Political dynamics matter even when performance is undeniable
- Optics matter even when substance is there

### The Lesson Learned
"Optics are everything."

Not that optics should replace substance — but that ignoring optics means substance doesn't get recognized.

## Pattern 2: People Invest in Me Before I've Proven Anything

### The Evidence
1. **Marketplace seller**: Fronted Technics turntables on a payment plan contract
2. **Uber driver**: Shipped a $1,000 MPC 2000 XL as a gift
3. **Heath at MixMax**: Gave "the opportunity of a lifetime" after meeting in a course
4. **Josh Poppas**: Brought into consulting work during the gap period
5. **Dr. Kiefer**: Invited on 120 total days of South American fieldwork

### The Diagnosis
"That's not luck. That's something about you that makes people want to bet on you."

There's a quality that makes people want to invest:
- Before proof of concept
- Before demonstrated results
- Based on potential they see

### The Responsibility
This is a gift, but it comes with obligation:
- Heath invested and I didn't deliver
- The next opportunity has to honor the investment

## Pattern 3: Rebuilding the Engine When They Need the Car Driven

### The Evidence
- **IROC-Z**: Stripped to the frame and rebuilt when most people would just drive it
- **MixMax**: Built frameworks and infrastructure instead of shipping campaigns
- **Music**: Still building capability, no releases yet

### The Diagnosis
The deep understanding approach creates thorough, quality work — but it also delays delivery.

At MixMax: "I had full autonomy and I drowned in it."
- No one was forcing me to ship
- I kept building the system instead of running the system
- The contract ended before campaigns went out

### The Lesson
"Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect."

The creative solve, the system rebuild, the elegant solution has to come after the basics are shipped, not instead of them.

---

## Pattern 4: Excellence in Constraints

### The Evidence
- **Trace Air**: 2,200 contacts vs. peer's 8,800 — still hit 20 demos (record month), 18 self-sourced
- **Independent research**: 120 total days in challenging field conditions with handheld equipment
- **Music**: Budget digging ($1 records), MPC 2000 XL as primary tool

### The Diagnosis
Limitations force creativity. When resources are scarce:
- Can't rely on volume to compensate for lack of precision
- Have to find angles others miss
- Constraints become features, not bugs

### The Philosophy
"Diamonds from dirt. Challenging yourself with limitations."

---

## Pattern 5: The Learning-by-Teardown Approach

### The Evidence
- **IROC-Z**: Stripped entire car to understand every system
- **GTM at Biofourmis Inc.**: Reverse-engineered the hospital readmission problem before dialing
- **Music production**: Started with computer, moved to hardware, went deeper into the craft
- **Organic chemistry**: Grinded until mastery (105/100)

### The Diagnosis
I don't learn by using something — I learn by taking it apart.

This creates deep understanding but requires time investment before productivity.

---

## Pattern 6: Quality Over Quantity (As Excuse and Strength)

### The Evidence

**As Strength**:
- Biofourmis Inc.: 20-40 focused calls vs. expected 80 random calls → Better results
- Trace Air: Targeted outreach → Record demos from smaller territory

**As Excuse**:
- MixMax: "Building it right" → Nothing shipped
- The pattern of depth over speed becoming justification for not delivering

### The Honest Assessment
"I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume."

Quality vs. quantity isn't always a choice — sometimes the business needs both, or needs volume first.

# THE IDENTIFIED GAPS

## Political Navigation
- Fired twice despite top performance
- "Stood up" in ways that created enemies
- Intellectually understand managing up, don't execute consistently

## Shipping Speed
- MixMax proved full autonomy without deadlines = drowning
- Tendency to build systems before running campaigns
- The new commitment is unproven

## Optics Management
- Results without visibility don't get recognized
- Activity metrics ignored at personal cost
- Communication "goes over heads" when riffing

## Working with Limited Engagement
- Need a leader with bandwidth for feedback
- Struggled when leadership was spread thin at MixMax
- "Full autonomy" without check-ins doesn't work

---

# THE COMMITMENT (POST-ANALYSIS)

## "Ship First. Deliver Before It's Perfect."

### What This Means
1. Priority is executing on expectations — delivering what was promised
2. The creative solve, the system rebuild, the elegant solution comes after the basics are shipped
3. Proactive communication about what I'm DOING (not thinking about doing)
4. Be dependable — say what I'll do, do it when I said, every time

### Simultaneously
- Build the swing that elevates multiple teams internally
- Bring great ideas to product at all times
- Never gatekeep

### Why This Is Different
At MixMax, I had the builder mentality from day one:
- "Let me build this properly"
- "Let me create the right system"
- "Let me do it the way it should be done"

That's the right instinct for the wrong situation. When you're on a contract with deliverable expectations, you ship first. You earn the right to rebuild the engine by first demonstrating you can drive the car.

# WHAT I NEED (SYNTHESIZED)

## From the Role

### Autonomy with Guardrails
- Not "do whatever you want" (MixMax → drowned)
- Not "hit 80 calls or else" (Biofourmis Inc. → fired despite results)
- Clear expectations with freedom in execution

### Time-Bound Deliverables
- Deadlines create shipping
- Without external forcing function, I build forever
- Need the structure I won't create myself

### Product I Believe In
- Experience at Barbour Orthopedics showed the business side of healthcare and turned me sour
- Won't do "smile and dial" without belief in value
- The consultative approach requires genuine conviction

### Long-Term Potential
- Never been promoted within a company
- Looking for somewhere to "level up and get promoted"
- Not another contract that ends early

## From the Leader/Manager

### Engaged, Not Overwhelmed
- MixMax: Great person, spread too thin
- Need someone with bandwidth for feedback and course correction
- The "check-in" isn't micromanagement — it's the guardrail I need

### Not Threatened
- Trace Air: Manager felt threatened, politicked against me
- I need a manager who can handle a direct report with ideas
- Secure leadership, not defensive leadership

### Willing to Translate
- When I'm riffing, I need a partner who can translate
- "This is what he's saying" to stakeholders who don't speak my language
- Someone who bridges the communication gap

## From the Team

### Co-Pilot
- "It takes more than me to create music"
- Same in GTM: Need collaborators, not just independence
- Someone to build with, not just work alongside

### Creative + Elite
- Organized Noize model: Creative team with mentorship
- Learning environment where I'm not the ceiling
- Room to absorb from people better than me

# THE HONEST SELF-ASSESSMENT

## Biggest Strength
Finding what's hidden in plain sight — whether that's:
- The sample in a common record no one else flipped
- The hospital readmission angle that closes a $1M deal
- The 18 contacts in a "dead" territory that become demos

## Biggest Weakness
Shipping speed and execution discipline.
"I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume."

## Most Consistent Pattern
"Being right but still losing."
Top performer twice, fired twice. Results prove the approach, but results without optics don't survive.

## What Has to Change
1. Ship first, iterate later
2. Communicate about doing, not thinking
3. Make the optics match the substance
4. Find the right environment (autonomy + guardrails)
5. Deliver on the trust people place in me

---

# THE SUMMARY STATEMENT

- Can attract investment from people who see potential

## What I Haven't Proven (Yet)
- Can ship fast enough when there's no external deadline
- Can manage optics as well as substance
