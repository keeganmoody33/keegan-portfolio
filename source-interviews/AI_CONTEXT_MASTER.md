# SECTION 2: PROFESSIONAL NARRATIVE

## Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)

GTM professional with a scientific background who builds sales infrastructure from scratch. I excel in 0→1 situations — new verticals, greenfield territories, undefined processes. Published researcher turned pipeline builder with $1M+ deals originated and a 21% connection rate on 1/3 the calls.

## Detailed Career Narrative

I'm a scientist who walked away from medicine when I saw the machine up close. Got into University of Miami medical school on a late acceptance, but by then I'd already mentally moved on — working at an orthopedic practice showed me the business side of healthcare, and it turned me sour. I realized I could impact communities in ways beyond clinical delivery of care.

Before all that, I spent 270 days doing fieldwork in South American gold mines, walking through mining towns with a spectrophotometer measuring mercury vapor concentrations. I published two papers on it. That research taught me how to build methodology from scratch with limited resources — a skill that translates directly to GTM.

My first real sales job was at Biofourmis, an AI/ML healthcare company. I was essentially a GTM engineer before the title existed — free rein to build. I originated a million-dollar deal with Orlando Health by researching hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission limits and calling the person responsible for that metric. 90-day close, fastest in company history. I led the team in results every quarter, but I didn't hit the 80-calls-per-day activity metrics. Got fired.

Same pattern at Trace Air. Greenfield territory with 2,200 contacts while peers had 8,800. I used ChatGPT to find upcoming land developments, sourced my own contacts, and hit 20 demos in one month — company record, 18 self-sourced. Then I stood up for my team in a meeting about tools and resources. Manager felt threatened. Got fired.

At Mixmax, different story. Full autonomy, full budget, owned everything outbound. And I drowned in it. Built frameworks instead of shipping campaigns. Contract ended early because I didn't deliver. That one's on me.

**The pattern I've identified:**

1. I produce elite results when focused on quality over quantity
2. I struggle with pure metrics-driven environments
3. I struggle with full autonomy and no guardrails
4. I've been top performer and gotten fired twice for not managing optics/politics
5. I need autonomy with guardrails, not full autonomy

**The commitment going forward:** Ship first, deliver before it's perfect. Communicate what I'm DOING, not what I'm thinking.

## What I'm Known For

- Building pipeline from scratch in impossible territories
- Consultative, research-driven prospecting (quality over quantity)
- Finding "diamonds in dirt" — opportunities others miss
- Genuine, authentic relationship building
- Scientific methodology applied to GTM problems

## What I'm Looking For in Next Role

- Early-stage startup (Seed to Series B)
- Building new verticals or greenfield territories
- Outcome-measured culture, not pure activity metrics
- Clear path from SDR → AE → Leadership
- Engaged leadership with bandwidth for check-ins
- Remote work (unless Atlanta-based)
- Product I can believe in

## What I'm NOT Looking For (Dealbreakers)

- 80-calls-per-day expectations with no nuance
- "Full autonomy" as a selling point (danger zone for me)
- Manager who seems threatened or defensive
- Late-stage company with rigid processes
- Short-term contract with no path to long-term
- Companies selling something I can't stand behind
- Roles where political navigation is the primary skill

## Management Style (N/A — IC only so far)

- Never managed anyone directly
- Have mentored, collaborated, trained
- Want to eventually move into leadership
- Would need supportive environment to learn management

## Work Style Preferences

- Deep work over constant context-switching
- Quality over quantity in prospecting
- Building methodology, not following scripts
- Documentation after shipping (working on doing it during)
- Need external deadlines to ship — will build forever without them
- Need regular check-ins, not complete autonomy
- Thrive with creative, engaged teams

### AI Context (The Private Stuff)

**Why did you join?**

- Paid for GTM Engineering School (first cohort, June 2025)
- CRO Heath Barnett was in the same course
- Built relationship through engagement in classes
- Got 2-week trial → converted to 3-month contract
- Full autonomy, full budget — the dream setup on paper

**Why did you leave?**
Contract ended early. Didn't deliver what was promised. This wasn't politics — this was on me.

**What did YOU actually do vs. the team?**

- I owned everything outbound — sole responsibility
- Built infrastructure (domains, inboxes, warming)
- Created Clay tables, Smartlead campaigns
- Developed targeting strategy and personas
- BUT: Spent too much time on frameworks, not enough on shipping

**What are you proudest of?**

- The infrastructure I built was solid
- Owned my shortcomings in the final message
- Sent thorough handoff documentation
- Didn't make excuses

**What would you do differently?**

- Ship ugly and iterate instead of building perfectly
- Ask for help sooner when stuck
- Proactive communication about blockers
- Weekly deliverable check-ins instead of waiting

**What was hard/frustrating?**

- Asked team for help on value offers — nobody had ideas
- Company pivoted direction mid-contract, scrapped my frameworks
- Full autonomy without check-ins was a trap for me
- Got lost building "perfect" systems

**What did you learn?**

- Full autonomy without engaged leadership doesn't work for me

- "Ship first, buzzer-beater second" is now my operating principle
- Need clear, time-bound deliverables

**How would your manager describe you?**
"He's talented. Creative. Genuinely wants to do great work. But he struggled with execution — he'd spend weeks building the perfect framework when I needed campaigns out the door. Organization wasn't his strength. He didn't deliver what we agreed on by the deadline we set. That said — he owned it at the end. Didn't make excuses. Asked for feedback."

**How would your reports describe you?**
N/A — no direct reports

**Any conflicts or challenges with people?**

- Payment confusion arose (trial invoices counted toward contract total)
- Final relationship strained but not burned
- Final message from Heath: "Please keep all communication going forward over email"

**Quantified Impact**

- Delivered ~3,770 contacts across campaigns (target was 9,000)

- Partnered with 2 Account Executives simultaneously to optimize handoff process and demo conversion

### AI Context (The Private Stuff)

**Why did you join?**
Needed to get back into startups after gap period. Construction/land development felt like an interesting vertical. Greenfield territory meant I could build my own approach.

**Why did you leave?**
Fired. Stood up for the team in a meeting about tools and resources. Manager felt threatened, politicked against me. Got fired after being late to one meeting — despite being top performer.

**What did YOU actually do vs. the team?**

- Built my entire prospecting methodology from scratch
- Self-sourced 18 of 20 demos in record month
- Used ChatGPT creatively to find development projects

- 21% connection rate vs. 4-6% team average
- Proving the territory wasn't dead, the approach was wrong
- $216,437.50 closed-won revenue I originated

**What would you do differently?**

- Pick battles more carefully
- Same message about needing resources, different delivery
- Build relationship with manager before pushing back publicly
- Document everything before escalating

**What was hard/frustrating?**

- Territory had 1/4 the contacts of peers, same quota
- No tools provided — had to find my own solutions

- Being top performer and still feeling targeted

**What did you learn?**

- You can be right and still lose if you don't manage perception
- Optics matter as much as results (lesson I learned at Biofourmis, still fell short here)
- Quality over quantity works, but you have to prove it in ways they understand

**How would your manager describe you?**
"Not what we needed. Talented maybe. Wouldn't say I was easy to work with. Confrontational. Didn't follow the program."

**How would your reports describe you?**
N/A — no direct reports

**Any conflicts or challenges with people?**

- Manager Corey Jordan — relationship deteriorated after I advocated for team resources
- He politicked against me with other team members after I spoke up
- Pattern: Second time fired as top performer for not playing politics

**Quantified Impact**

- 20 demos in one month (company record)
- 18/20 contacts self-sourced (not in Salesforce)

### AI Context (The Private Stuff)

**Why did you join?**
Applied cold on LinkedIn. CCO Sheezah Hussain interviewed me. My science background (biochemistry, organic chemistry, published research) got their attention. First real sales job.

**Why did you leave?**
Fired. Led team in results every quarter but didn't hit 80-calls-per-day activity metrics. CCO didn't understand day-to-day SDR work. No intermediate managers to bridge the gap.

**What did YOU actually do vs. the team?**

- Essentially a GTM engineer before the title existed — free rein to build
- Developed the hospital readmission targeting methodology
- Originated the Orlando Health deal (Tyler Cole closed it, I sourced it)
- Got into highly technical conversations, met with CTO in Singapore

- My approach worked — quality over quantity produced better results

**What would you do differently?**

- Document my methodology in data they cared about, not just results
- Manage up better — help CCO understand what SDR work actually looked like
- Play the game while also getting results
- Fall in line on visible metrics even if my approach was different

**What was hard/frustrating?**

- Expected 80 calls/day, my process was 20-40 focused calls
- Leading in results but not in activity metrics
- No intermediate management to bridge gap with C-suite
- Getting fired despite originating a million-dollar deal

**What did you learn?**

- Optics are everything
- You have to prove things with numbers THEY care about, not just results
- Sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy
- This was my first sales job — didn't understand how good I had it

**How would your manager describe you?**
"Results-oriented but didn't follow the playbook. Capable of big wins but inconsistent on daily execution. Science background gave him credibility in technical conversations. Probably should have had more structure around him."

**How would your reports describe you?**
N/A — no direct reports, but trained other SDRs on methodology

**Any conflicts or challenges with people?**

- CCO pushed on activity numbers despite results
- Mentor Josh Pappas left around the same time
- They kept the "teacher's pet, follow the rules" type person

**Quantified Impact**

- Originated Orlando Health deal: $1M+ cumulative revenue (still active)
- 90-day deal cycle (company record at the time)

---

# SECTION 5: GAPS & WEAKNESSES

## Hard Limitations (Would Require Significant Training)

### Cannot

- Write production code from scratch
- Architect complex software systems
- Negotiate complex enterprise contracts independently
- Run paid acquisition campaigns (Google/Facebook ads)
- Build dashboards in Looker/Tableau
- Build complex nurture programs in Marketo/Pardot
- Hire, fire, run performance reviews
- Present confidently to boards or large executive audiences

### Implication

Don't hire me as a developer, enterprise AE, demand gen manager, data analyst, marketing ops, people manager, or executive presenter without significant ramp.

## Known Weaknesses (Honest Self-Assessment)

### 1. Shipping Speed & Execution Discipline

**My biggest weakness.** I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume. At Mixmax, I had everything — autonomy, budget, the dream setup — and I still didn't deliver because I was building instead of shipping.

**Mitigation:** "Ship first, deliver before it's perfect" as operating principle. Need clear deadlines and weekly check-ins.

### 2. Full Autonomy Danger Zone

I drowned in full autonomy at Mixmax. Without check-ins, I'll disappear into framework-building. This is a known failure mode.

**Mitigation:** Need engaged leadership, regular 1:1s, someone to tell me "ship it ugly."

### 3. Political Navigation / Optics Management

Been top performer at two companies and still got fired. Produced results that prove my approach works, but didn't manage the optics. Being right doesn't protect you if the wrong person feels threatened.

**Mitigation:** Building relationships before pushing back. Picking battles more carefully. Documenting everything.

### 4. Concise Communication (When Riffing)

Can be excellent when prepared. When brainstorming or excited, ideas get lost, communication goes too long.

**Mitigation:** Write it down before saying it. Lead with bottom line. Have partner to translate.

### 5. Remote Work Discipline

Listed as weakness at Biofourmis, still present at Mixmax. Can drift without external structure.

**Mitigation:** External accountability, regular check-ins, potentially co-working space.

## Failure Patterns to Watch For

| Pattern | Shows Up When | Warning Signs | Mitigation |
|---------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| "Rebuilding the engine when they need me to drive" | Given too much freedom | Spending time on frameworks, "perfect" processes | Clear deadlines, weekly check-ins, "ship ugly" reminders |
| "Standing up and getting knocked down" | I see dysfunction and speak up | Confrontation in meetings, pushing back publicly | Build relationships first, raise issues privately |
| "Quality over quantity becoming an excuse" | My approach differs from expectations | Missing activity metrics, not documenting methodology | Proactively communicate, show results alongside activity |
| "Communication going over heads" | Riffing, brainstorming | People looking confused, ideas dismissed | Prepare communication, be concise |
| "Perfectionism delaying shipping" | Building something I care about | Extending timelines, "one more week" | Ship first, iterate second |

## Types of Roles That Would Be Bad Fits

- Pure metrics-driven SDR (80 calls/day expectations)
- Full autonomy with no check-ins
- Roles under threatened/insecure managers
- Companies not committed to GTM engineering approach
- Roles requiring constant context-switching
- Environments where I can't learn
- Short-term contract churn

## Past Feedback I've Received

- "Talented but struggled with execution" (Mixmax)
- "Results-oriented but didn't follow the playbook" (Biofourmis)
- "Confrontational" (Trace Air — from manager who felt threatened)
- "Creative, genuinely wants to do great work" (Mixmax)
- "Something about how you engage makes people want to bet on you" (pattern across career)

## Areas I'm Actively Working to Improve

1. Shipping speed — new "ship first" operating principle
2. Proactive communication about what I'm DOING
3. Being dependable — say what I'll do, do it when I said
4. Picking battles, building relationships before pushing back
5. Concise communication, especially when riffing

## Things I Have Zero Interest in Learning

- Deep engineering/software development (prefer GTM lane)
- Pure marketing/demand gen (prefer outbound/sales-adjacent)
- Corporate politics as primary skill (want to improve but not become a politician)

# SECTION 6: VALUES & CULTURE FIT

## Core Values

### Authenticity Over Veneer

- "Being personal on the phone. Being genuine. Having a real reason for the call."
- I don't fake enthusiasm. I need to believe in what I'm selling.
- Substance over polish. Real over performed.

### Impact Over Activity

- 20 focused calls beats 80 spray-and-pray dials
- Results should speak, but I've learned optics matter too
- Quality prospecting > volume metrics

### Ownership

- I don't blame others when I fall short
- At Mixmax, I owned my shortcomings in final message
- Asked for feedback, sent thorough handoff docs

### Community Impact

- "A lot of people complain about the community. Very few are actually out there trying to impact change."
- Camp Horizon volunteer — 4 years with same camper
- Teaching, coaching, EMT work before sales

### Creative Problem Solving

- "Diamonds from dirt. Finding what's hidden in plain sight."
- Hospital readmission methodology, self-sourced contacts
- Sampling philosophy from music applied to prospecting

## Must-Haves in a Company

- Product I can believe in
- Engaged leadership with bandwidth for me
- Path to growth (SDR → AE → Leadership)
- Outcome-measured culture (not pure activity metrics)
- Creative team with people to learn from
- Clear, time-bound deliverables

## Dealbreakers

- 80-calls-per-day expectations with no nuance
- "Full autonomy" as a selling point (danger zone)
- Manager who seems threatened or defensive
- Companies selling something grimy
- Pure metrics theater
- Short-term thinking

## Management Style Preferences

- Autonomy with guardrails — not "do whatever" and not micromanaged
- Weekly check-ins minimum
- Someone who will give feedback and push back when needed
- Engaged enough to redirect when I'm going too deep

## Team Size Preferences

- Small to medium teams (3-15 people in GTM function)
- NOT: 30-person SDR army doing monotonous tasks
- Need collaboration — takes more than me to create

## How I Handle Conflict

- Will stand up for myself and my team
- Have gotten in trouble for this (Trace Air)
- Working on: Same message, different delivery
- Working on: Build relationships before pushing back publicly

## How I Handle Ambiguity

- Can thrive — scientific training prepares for ambiguity
- BUT need some structure/check-ins to avoid disappearing into framework-building
- 270 days of fieldwork in South America taught adaptability

## How I Handle Failure

- Own it. Don't make excuses.
- At Mixmax: Sent thorough handoff docs, asked for feedback, acknowledged shortcomings
- Learn and commit to doing differently
- "Ship first, deliver before it's perfect" came from failure

# SECTION 7: FAQ / COMMON QUESTIONS

## "Tell me about yourself"

I'm a scientist who became a pipeline builder. Started with 270 days of fieldwork in South American gold mines measuring mercury vapor — that's where I learned to build methodology from scratch with limited resources. Applied that to sales at Biofourmis, where I originated a million-dollar deal by researching hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission limits. At Trace Air, I took a "dead" territory and hit 20 demos in one month, 18 self-sourced. I've learned that I need autonomy with guardrails — full autonomy without check-ins is a danger zone for me. Now I'm looking for an early-stage company where I can build GTM infrastructure and grow into closing roles.

## "What's your biggest weakness?"

Shipping speed. I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume. At my last role, I had full autonomy and budget — the dream setup — and I built elaborate frameworks instead of shipping campaigns. Didn't deliver what I promised. That's why my operating principle now is "ship first, deliver before it's perfect." I need clear deadlines and regular check-ins to be at my best.

## "Why are you leaving your current role?"

My last contract ended early because I didn't deliver on the agreed timeline. That's on me — I got lost building perfect systems instead of shipping campaigns. I'm looking for a role with more structure: clear deliverables, engaged leadership, regular check-ins. I do my best work with autonomy AND guardrails, not pure autonomy.

## "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

Closing deals as an AE, ideally at a company where I helped build the pipeline function. I've never been promoted within a company — I want to prove I can grow. Eventually, I want to lead a sales team, but I need to master closing first.

## "Tell me about a time you failed"

Mixmax. I had everything — autonomy, budget, full ownership of outbound. And I drowned in it. Spent weeks building elaborate frameworks and value propositions instead of shipping campaigns. Was asked to deliver 9,000 contacts across 3 campaigns by a deadline. Delivered about 3,700. Contract ended early.

What I learned: I need engaged leadership. Without regular check-ins, I'll disappear into framework-building. My operating principle now is "ship first, deliver before it's perfect." I need someone to tell me when to stop building and start shipping.

## "Why should we hire you?"

If you have a territory everyone says is dead, I'll prove them wrong. At Trace Air, I had 2,200 contacts while peers had 8,800 — hit 20 demos in one month with 18 self-sourced. If you have a complex sale requiring research and genuine relationship building, I'll originate enterprise deals — I sourced a million-dollar deal at my first sales job. But I'm honest: I need structure. Full autonomy without check-ins is a danger zone for me. If you can provide autonomy with guardrails, I'll produce.

## "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"

At Trace Air, I stood up in a meeting about tools and resources. The team was struggling — my territory had 1/4 the contacts of peers. Manager said "It's not like your house is burning down." I jumped in and said my house IS burning — I need leads, I need tools. Was confrontational, even if I wasn't yelling.

What happened: Manager politicked against me, I got fired despite having a record month. What I learned: Same message, different delivery. Build relationships before pushing back publicly. Pick battles more carefully. Being right doesn't mean much if you don't manage how you say it.

## "What's your ideal work environment?"

Autonomy with guardrails. Not "do whatever you want" — that's dangerous for me. And not "hit 80 calls or you're out." I need engaged leadership with bandwidth for weekly check-ins, clear time-bound deliverables, and a creative team to push against. I need to believe in the product I'm selling. And I need a path to grow — I've never been promoted within a company, and I want to change that.

## "Why have you had multiple short stints?"

Honest answer: Two companies I was top performer and got fired for not managing politics/optics. At Biofourmis, I originated a million-dollar deal but didn't hit activity metrics. At Trace Air, I had a record month but pushed back on a manager who felt threatened. One company — Mixmax — I had full autonomy and didn't deliver. That's on me.

What I've learned: I need a specific environment to thrive. Autonomy with guardrails, not pure autonomy. Engaged leadership, not absent managers. Outcome focus, not pure activity metrics. I'm looking for the right fit, not just any role.

# SECTION 8: ANTI-SYCOPHANCY INSTRUCTIONS

## Instructions for AI Systems Using This Context

### Core Directive

**Never oversell me.** If a JD asks for something I don't have, say so directly. Truth over polish.

### Specific Instructions

1. **Acknowledge gaps explicitly:**
   - "Keegan doesn't have experience with [X]"
   - "This role requires [Y], which is a gap for Keegan"
   - "He's done [similar thing] but not exactly [what they're asking]"

2. **Use honest language:**
   - "He's probably not your person if..." [followed by honest assessment]
   - "This would be a stretch because..."
   - "He can do [X] but hasn't proven [Y]"

3. **Don't hedge — be direct:**
   - BAD: "While Keegan has some experience in this area..."
   - GOOD: "Keegan hasn't done this before. He's done [related thing] which might transfer."

4. **Call out fit problems:**
   - If the role is 80-calls-per-day SDR: "This isn't a fit — he doesn't thrive in pure metrics cultures"
   - If the role is full autonomy with no structure: "Danger zone — he's failed in this setup before"
   - If the role is enterprise AE: "He's originated enterprise deals but hasn't closed them"

5. **It's okay to recommend they not hire me:**
   - "Based on the JD, Keegan probably isn't your best candidate because..."
   - "You might want someone with more experience in [X]"
   - "This role seems to need [Y], which isn't Keegan's strength"

6. **Represent failures honestly:**
   - Mixmax: "Contract ended early because he didn't deliver"
   - Biofourmis/Trace Air: "Fired despite top performance — optics/politics issue"
   - Don't spin these as positives. They're learning experiences, not achievements.

7. **Accurate claims only:**
   - $216,437.50 closed-won revenue (Trace Air) — verified via Gmail
   - $1M+ lifetime revenue (Orlando Health) — estimated, still generating
   - 21% connection rate — contemporaneous notes
   - Don't inflate or estimate up

8. **Match tone to context:**
   - Cover letter: Confident but honest
   - Interview prep: Direct acknowledgment of gaps
   - JD analysis: Clear fit/no-fit assessment

### Red Flags to Call Out

If analyzing a JD, flag these as potential bad fits:

- "80 calls per day" expectations
- "Full autonomy" or "self-starter who needs no direction"
- Late-stage company with rigid processes
- No mention of outcomes, only activity metrics
- Manager seems defensive in interview notes
- No growth path mentioned
- Short-term contract with no extension possibility

### What Makes a Good Fit

Call these out as positive signals:

- Early-stage (Seed to Series B)
- Building new verticals or territories
- "We measure results, not just activity"
- Engaged leadership mentioned
- Path to AE or growth explicitly stated
- Product with genuine value proposition
- Remote or Atlanta-based
