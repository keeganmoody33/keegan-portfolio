# Career Deep-Dive Interview: The Real Story

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Extract honest career context for portfolio and resume development  
**Format:** Raw interview synthesis — no polish, no LinkedIn speak

## Executive Summary: Who You Are

You're a scientist who walked away from medicine when you saw the machine up close. You're a builder who learns by taking things apart — cars, systems, sounds. You're a digger who finds what's hidden in plain sight. You're someone people invest in before you've proven anything — turntables, MPCs, contracts, opportunities — because they see something in you.

You've got 120 total days of fieldwork in South American mines. You've spent a month of your life with a foster kid who has no one else. You originated a million-dollar deal at your first sales job. You booked 20 demos with 18 contacts you sourced yourself when everyone said the territory was dead.

You've also been fired twice. You've struggled with shipping, with optics, with communicating concisely. You've drowned in autonomy and suffocated without it.

**The commitment going forward:** Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect. Communicate what you're doing, not what you're thinking.

## Part 1: Education & Background

### Mercer University (Graduated May 2019)
- **Location:** Macon, Georgia
- **Honors:** Summa Cum Laude (highest honors attainable at graduation)
- **GPA:** 3.83
- **Involvement:** SGA Senate, extensive community service, super involved on campus
- **Focus:** Biochemistry / Organic Chemistry

---

## Part 2: The Career Timeline (Honest Version)

### The Medical School Pivot

**The polished version:** "I didn't get into medical school."

**The real version:** You got into medical school — University of Miami, late acceptance — but by then you had already made up your mind to go elsewhere. It wasn't that you turned it down; the timing was too late. You'd already mentally moved on.

**What actually happened:**
- Took the MCAT twice
- 99th percentile on biochemistry and science sections
- Applied to 30+ schools, many late
- Got accepted to Miami on late admission
- By that point, had already made the decision to pivot

---

### Job 1: Chapel Hill Middle School & Chapel Hill High School (Gap Year, 2019–2020)

**Context:** This was planned as your gap year before medical school.

#### Chapel Hill Middle School — Special Education Paraprofessional
- 6th, 7th, and 8th grade
- High-functioning autistic boys
- Classroom of approximately 8 students
- **Taught everything:** People skills, literature, math, history
- **Raw experience:** Got stabbed in the back with a pencil. Split up fights. Had terrible days, had amazing days.
- **Key takeaway:** "You could have a terrible job. And if you're with great people, that job's pretty great as well."

#### Chapel Hill High School — Defensive Football Coach (Simultaneous)
- Defensive coach for varsity
- Handled the majority of JV games — rode the bus, chaperoned, oversaw things while head coaches prepared for Friday night varsity
- Also on varsity sidelines with headset
- At practice every day
- Waking up early, giving kids rides to school

**Summary:** "What a great job. Those two things simultaneously, as I was just in my gap year — really kind of figuring out what the real world was about."

---

### COVID Hit (March/April 2020)
- Went home from school
- Gap year extended

---

### Job 2: Barbour Orthopedics (July 2020)

**Type:** Private orthopedic practice specializing in surgery

**Context:** 
- 5 offices in Metro Atlanta
- Eventually ran the front desk at Forest Park location
- Had a key
- Trained people

**What you actually did:**
- Processed all paperwork on the front end
- Handled patient intake
- Understanding how treatments impacted recoveries
- **Customer service standout:** "I show I care by action. I'm polite, stand up when someone walks in, hold the door for them. If they can't get out of the car, I go grab them, pick them up, put them in the wheelchair, wheel them in."
- Doing the hardest tasks — cleaning toilets, picking up trash, maintaining the office
- Going above and beyond

**What you learned:**
- Showed you the business side of healthcare you were unaware of
- The attention to detail you were paying to things — how the business operated, how decisions were made
- This experience turned you sour on the healthcare business side
- You realized you could impact communities in ways beyond clinical delivery of care
- Key insight that shaped your pivot away from medicine

---

### Job 3: Biofourmis Inc. (August 2021)

**IMPORTANT FRAMING:** From day one, frame Biofourmis Inc. as an **artificial intelligence and machine learning healthcare tech company/startup.** This is crucial for positioning your AI/ML exposure early.

**What Biofourmis does:**
- Extends the four walls of hospitals
- Predicts patient deterioration proactively
- Patient interfaces — means to communicate baseline vitals
- Machine learning based on a suite of vitals
- Clinician interfaces for care teams

**How you got there:**
- Brought in by the **Chief Commercial Officer (Shiza Hussein)**
- Connected remotely with the CTO in Singapore — him technically walking you through how things are working
- Being hungry to learn

**Your role:**
- Second SDR brought on
- **Claim: Co-founding SDR** — the first SDR (Ryan) wasn't doing much before you got there
- You and Ryan developed the methodology, the plan, the playbook together
- Using HubSpot, sending 500 emails a day (that's how it used to be)
- "Acting like sharks on Zoom Info, because we could" — Zoom Info was new and revolutionary at the time

**Mentor:** Josh Poppas — Director of Digital Health at the time, one of the most tenured, resided under the CCO

**Milestone:** 
- Around 8 months in (on your birthday, April 26), town hall declared **unicorn status**
- Big deals, big money

#### The Value Prop: ER Readmissions

**How the federal readmission system works:**
- The federal/country's average determines who gets fined
- If you're above the average, you get fined
- The fines get larger the larger the difference between your readmission rate and the average

**Your approach:**
- Public information: You can see that Hospital X got fined $8.3 million last year because of their readmission rate
- You call the person in charge of that metric
- You ask them: "What are you doing about this? What's your plan?"
- If they're open to entertaining a long shot on how to mitigate that — facilitating getting the readmission under the average — that saves them $8.3 million
- "They would definitely entertain the demo, right? If they were the right person."

**Philosophy:** "Being hospitable, being genuine, adding real value, and consistency."

#### Orlando Health Deal
- Tyler Cole (still at Biofourmis today) involved
- Orlando Health still publicly leveraging Biofourmis
- **Very fast close** — might have been less than 90 days
- Estimated $1M+ lifetime value

#### The Lesson (Still Fall Short On)
> "Optics are everything."

**What this means:**
- Not "learn to avoid friction at all costs" — you have to stand up for what you believe in
- But: Document everything
- Provide data-driven reasoning behind what you're doing
- Plans for everyone to succeed, and in turn, the team to succeed
- "This is not an ego battle at all."

---

### Gap Period (January–June/July, Post-Biofourmis)
- Did a lot of things
- Pushed carts at Home Depot to pay rent
- Did consulting work with Josh Poppas
- Knew you wanted to get back into the startup game

---

### Job 4: Trace Air (traceair.net)

**Type:** Software-as-a-Service for land development

**What Trace Air does:**
- Flies your project at a set cadence with drones
- Very new, innovative technology in a very old market
- Old ideas and old notions — very hard to overcome

**Your performance:** "I killed it."

**What helped:**
- Blue collar roots — dad is a heating and air man
- Being on the phone, talking to guys, playing accent
- "Huge switch up from the technical aspects and the healthcare politics"

**Key milestones:**
- **This is when you began to use tools like Clay** on your own terms — no tools provided, you were finding solutions, discovering stuff
- **First time leveraging video messaging** — via text message, via LinkedIn
- Found success there; this trend continues to grow and become more impactful

**Philosophy on video:**
> "Human interaction or validation that someone is human and authentic excuses flaws and maybe hiccups in your one-take that you send. It's authentic. I think authenticity and originality, and just being yourself, is the proof in the pudding. Video is the only way to do that right now."

**Pattern:** Another company on the forefront of markets, selling to early adopters (1–3% of TAM) — same as Biofourmis

#### Connection to Independent Research
- The overlay heat maps you created (like Weather Channel visuals) during your ASGM fieldwork were reminiscent of LIDAR and QGIS imaging at Trace Air
- Cool connection between your scientific past and GTM present

**Results:**
- 20 demos in a month
- 18 from contacts you sourced yourself
- Greenfield territory with 1/4 the contacts of peers

---

### End of 2024 into 2025

- Bariatric Centers of America situation (needed it at the time)
- Got interviewed a lot
- Realized: good resume, good skills, maybe not always a fit for teams

---

### Job 5: MixMax (November 2024 – January 2026)

**Major event:** Complete overhaul rebranding on **November 11** — changed domain from **MixMax.com to MixMax.ai**

**Your role:**
- Tasked with contributing to and supporting the newly established outbound system
- **Owned everything completely** — responsibility, budget
- Worked alongside RevOps
- Under the Chief Revenue Officer

**What you learned:**
- Had full autonomy and drowned in it
- Built frameworks instead of shipping campaigns
- Different from other situations — at Biofourmis and Trace Air, fired for politics despite top performance
- At MixMax, had full autonomy and didn't deliver — "That's on me."
- Contract ended early (not a firing — contract just ended)

---

## Part 3: The Commitment Going Forward

**The operating principle:**

> **Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect.**

Communicate what you're DOING — not what you're thinking, brainstorming, or excited about. Accelerate the business in real-time. Be dependable. Say what you'll do, do it when you said, every time.

Simultaneously: Build the swing that elevates multiple teams internally. Bring great ideas to product at all times. Never gatekeep.

---

## Part 4: Personal Foundation

### The 1987 Camaro IROC-Z

**Why IROC-Z:**
- Grandfather worked at General Motors — that's why the IROC-Z happened

**The Story:**
- Bought for ~$5,000, shipped from Indiana
- Inspiration: Watching the opening scene of "Hell or High Water" — the Texas bank robbers were driving an IROC-Z
- Had just sold your vehicle, ready to buy something

**What you actually did (full teardown and rebuild):**
- Blew the transmission within first month or two — had it rebuilt at AAMCO
- Replaced the fuel pump
- Replaced the alternator
- Tightened struts
- Cleaned all the tar off from Indiana (rust belt residue)
- Wrecked it, messed up the bumper
- Stripped the entire car to the frame
- Fiberglassed the bumper
- Sanded down extensive areas, got it ready for primer
- Took the entire front frame off, front fenders — everything
- Spotted and addressed rust issues throughout
- Added sound deadening material to interior
- Pulled out the stereo, did interior sound work

**What this shows:**
> "I learn by taking things apart."

This is how you approach everything — GTM systems, music production, problems. You don't just use something; you need to understand how it works from the inside out.

---

### Music

**This is super important.** You're passionate about music — people should know that. But it's personal, not professional.

**Equipment:**
- Technics turntables (one signed by Slick Rick)
- MPC 2000 XL (from an Uber driver who just shipped it to you)
- Old school **Casio** synth

**Record collection includes:**
- Sly and the Family Stone
- Janis Joplin
- Goodie Mob
- UGK
- Mobb Deep
- Gang Starr
- MF DOOM
- Thelonious Monk
- Isaac Hayes
- Freddie Gibbs
- Cam'ron

**Philosophy:**
> "Just listening, man, is a huge influence. Being able to be a good listener is huge."

**Future project (not up next):**
- Discogs API integration
- Set up a query/connection so people can ask about your collection, records you have, suggestions

---

## Part 5: Independent Research

**TERMINOLOGY:** Refer to undergraduate independent research (and what persisted after) as **independent research** or **ASGM research**.

**Duration:** 120 total days in South America

**Publications:** Two published papers — co-authored, up there on the authors list (not sixth author)

**Focus:** Research on **Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM)**

**Context:**
- Tasked by the **EPA** for a comprehensive analysis for the **Mercury Minamata Convention**
- Focus: Elemental mercury vapors in the atmosphere of South American mining towns
- Political context: Elemental mercury was deemed illegal in these countries — very hectic political environment

**Technical work:**
- **45,000+ data points** in Excel
- Each point = longitude, latitude, concentration — one per second
- "Think about if I walk for eight hours, how many points in Excel that is?"
- Worked in **Cinnabar mines**
- Cooked all this up in Excel

**Deliverables:**
- Overlay heat maps (like Weather Channel visuals)
- Comprehensive mapping of elemental mercury vapor concentrations

---

## Part 6: Formative Experiences

### Dr. Kiefer
- Key mentor lessons: "Nobody cares, stop complaining"

### Camp Horizon
- 4 years with the same foster child
- 1:1 ratio
- Most influential male figure in that child's life

### Teaching & Coaching
- Special education paraprofessional
- High school football coach
- The experience of working with great people making any job great

---

## Part 7: Lectures From

**Inspiration:** *Lectures on Gas Theory* by Ludwig Boltzmann
- The book's cover is the logo for lecturesfrom.com

**Origin of the name:**
> "I can be a guy that will give you a lecture on some stuff. I just can get to rambling. It's kind of funny."

**IMPORTANT:** Don't try to connect everything to Boltzmann — keep it light. The connection is the name and the logo, not a deep philosophical alignment across all projects.

**What Lectures From is:**
- A vehicle to generate and create software AND analog/physical products you love
- Can do GTM work under this if needed
- Can publish a book for someone, help with design
- Can get records pressed, create music
- Building products that matter, adding actual value to people in their creative process and day-to-day

**Known projects under Lectures From:**
- punch2pen
- Scuttle What
- Demonstrate
- Accolade
- Capture Ingest
- Bull-ish
- Feature Flip
- Engels Alleged
- And more developing

**What's NOT part of Lectures From:**
- GTM frameworks and utilities (like Gutenberg) — that's professional work, separate
- Music (for now) — personal, stays in the lab

---

## Part 8: What I Actually Need in an Environment

**The Right Fit:**
- Autonomy with guardrails — not "do whatever" and not "hit 80 calls or else"
- Engaged leadership with bandwidth — someone who can give feedback and check-ins, but not micromanage
- Clear, time-bound deliverables — so I don't disappear into framework-building
- A partner or senior who can translate my ideas when I'm riffing — because I struggle with concise communication sometimes
- A creative team with an elite mentor — someone I can learn from, get game from
- A product I believe in — I won't work somewhere doing grimy stuff
- Long-term potential — I want to level up, get promoted, prove growth within one company (I've never done this before)

**What I Don't Need:**
- Pure metrics-driven culture that doesn't value quality
- Complete autonomy with no check-ins
- Managers who feel threatened by capable ICs
- Companies not actually committed to the approach they're hiring for
- Short-term thinking about GTM engineering

---

## Part 9: The Patterns

### Top Performer Who Gets Fired
- Results at Biofourmis (originated Orlando Health deal)
- Results at Trace Air (20 demos, 18 self-sourced, record month)
- Still let go at both
- "Being right but still losing"

### People Invest Before Proof
- Turntables, MPCs, contracts, opportunities
- People see something and bet on it
- "That's a gift, but it's also a responsibility"

### Rebuilding the Engine When They Need You to Drive
- IROC-Z rebuild mentality applied to work
- Deep understanding vs. quick delivery tension
- Strength and weakness in the same trait

### The Optics Problem
- Results without documentation don't survive
- "Optics are everything"

### The Communication Gap
- Ideas come out complex
- Need someone to translate when riffing
- Struggle with concise communication

---

## Part 10: The Differentiator

> "An operator, creative force at the inseam of science, tech, and art."

Scientific rigor. GTM execution. Creative authenticity. Builder mentality.

---

## Part 11: Key Quotes in Your Own Words

**On the core commitment:**
> "Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect."

**On optics:**
> "Optics are everything."

**On the MixMax experience:**
> "I had full autonomy and I drowned in it."

**On quality vs. speed:**
> "I want to build things the right way, and that makes me slow when the business needs volume."

**On the pattern:**
> "Being right but still losing."

**On video messaging:**
> "Authenticity and originality, and just being yourself, is the proof in the pudding. Video is the only way to do that right now."

**On great people:**
> "You could have a terrible job. And if you're with great people, that job's pretty great as well."

**On listening:**
> "Just listening, man, is a huge influence. Being able to be a good listener is huge."

**On bringing value:**
> "Being hospitable, being genuine, adding real value, and consistency."

**On learning:**
> "I learn by taking things apart."
