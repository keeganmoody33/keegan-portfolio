# INDEPENDENT RESEARCH IN SOUTH AMERICA

**TERMINOLOGY NOTE:** Refer to this as **independent research** or **ASGM research**, not "mercury research."

## The Overview
- **Duration**: 120 total days of fieldwork
- **Location**: South America (multiple countries/regions)
- **Mentor**: Dr. Adam Kiefer
- **Focus**: Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) and elemental mercury vapor concentrations
- **Output**: Two published papers — co-authored, up there on the authors list (not sixth author)

## The Context

### EPA and Mercury Minamata Convention
- Tasked by the **EPA** for comprehensive analysis
- Work contributed to the **Mercury Minamata Convention**
- Focus: Elemental mercury vapors in the atmosphere of South American mining towns
- Political context: Elemental mercury was deemed illegal in these countries — very hectic political environment

### Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM)
- Informal/small-scale gold miners
- The process: Dump elemental mercury onto ore
- Mercury binds to gold particles
- Miners then burn off the mercury using aerosolized gasoline
- This creates mercury vapor — extremely toxic
- The communities are exposed to dangerous levels

### Why It Matters
- These are often impoverished communities
- Limited alternatives for income
- Health consequences are severe
- Environmental contamination persists

## My Actual Work

### The Equipment
- **Portable spectrophotometer** (Ohio Lumex)
- Handheld device for measuring mercury concentrations in the field
- Could get readings on-site rather than shipping samples to labs

### The Data Collection
- GPS coordinates at each measurement site
- Mercury concentration readings
- Environmental observations
- Community context
- **45,000+ data points** in Excel
- Each point = longitude, latitude, concentration — one per second
- "Think about if I walk for eight hours, how many points in Excel that is?"

### The Analysis
- **Created heat maps** pairing GPS coordinates with concentration data (like Weather Channel visuals)
- Used **VLOOKUPs and concatenations in Excel** to match location data with readings
- This is where I learned the Excel skills I still use today
- Visual representation of where contamination was highest

### The Locations
- Hostel to hostel through sketchy areas
- Non-Spanish speakers navigating alone
- Juan Cavallico — 14,000 feet elevation
- **Cinnabar mines**
- Community of Saxo Marca

## The Philosophy of the Work

### Not "White Savior" Research
"It wasn't about being the white savior who comes in and tells these communities they're wrong or that they need to stop. That's not the approach."

### Data for Informed Decisions
The goal was to give communities the information they needed to make their own choices:
- Here's what the elemental mercury levels actually are
- Here's where the hotspots are
- Here's what the science says about health effects
- Now you can decide what to do with this information

### Respecting Agency
"I'm not here to tell you what to do. I'm here to give you data so you can make an informed decision."

## What This Experience Built

### Technical Skills
- Data collection in challenging field conditions
- Excel mastery (VLOOKUPs, concatenations, data pairing)
- Working with scientific instruments
- Creating visualizations from raw data

### Professional Skills
- Working in ambiguous, resource-constrained environments
- Adapting to conditions on the ground
- Building trust with communities
- Translating technical findings into accessible information

### Mindset
- **Systematic thinking**: Scientific method applied to real problems
- **Humility**: I'm not the expert on their lives; I'm just providing data
- **Patience**: 120 total days of fieldwork requires sustained focus
- **Purpose**: The work matters beyond just my career

## Connection to GTM Work

### The Research Methodology → Prospecting
- At Biofourmis Inc.: Found hospitals over federal readmission limits (data-driven targeting)
- At Trace Air: Built target lists from limited data sources
- Same skill: Finding patterns in data that reveal where to focus

### The Heat Map Approach → Territory Mapping
- In research: Where are the concentration hotspots?
- In GTM: Where are the opportunity hotspots?
- Same skill: Visualizing data to identify where to concentrate effort
- Connection: LIDAR and QGIS imaging at Trace Air was reminiscent of the heat maps from fieldwork

### The Consultative Approach
- In research: "Here's the data — you decide"
- In sales: "Here's what I'm seeing in your readmission numbers — you decide"
- Same skill: Giving people information rather than pushing solutions

# DR. ADAM KIEFER (Mentor)

## Who He Is
- Young guy from Newark, New Jersey
- Organic chemistry mentor
- Took me to South America for the independent research

## What He Taught Me

### "Nobody Cares. Stop Complaining. You Can Learn Anything If You Put In the Work."

This is the core lesson. When I was struggling or making excuses:
- Nobody cares about your obstacles
- Stop complaining about what's hard
- Put in the work and you can learn anything

### The Organic Chemistry Breakthrough

**The Setup**:
- Organic chemistry is notoriously difficult
- Large class (around 80 students)
- Most people struggle or fail

**What Happened**:
- First exam: I got **105/100** (extra credit)
- I was the only person in the class to score above 90
- Changed half my answers in the last 10 minutes
- Then I went on a streak — near-perfect performance

**How I Did It**:
- Grinding in the library
- Putting in the hours
- No shortcuts, just work
- Applied Dr. Kiefer's philosophy

**The Lesson**:
"You can learn anything if you put in the work."

This wasn't natural talent. It was effort applied correctly.

### Being Proud of Accomplishments

Dr. Kiefer also taught me to own my successes:
- When you achieve something, acknowledge it
- Don't diminish what you've done
- This is something I still struggle with

## How This Shows Up Now

### The Work Ethic
- At Biofourmis Inc.: I outworked everyone on results, even if not on activity metrics
- At Trace Air: Found 18 contacts no one else found through sheer effort
- At MixMax: Built entire systems from scratch

### The Learning Approach
- IROC-Z: Taught myself body work, mechanical work, fiberglass
- Music: Taught myself production, sampling, the MPC
- GTM: Taught myself Clay, Smartlead, email infrastructure

### The Gap
- Still struggle to take credit for accomplishments
- Still deflect when I should own my wins
- This is ongoing work

# CAMP HORIZON

## What It Is
- Camp for foster children
- Ages: Originally 8-12, now also teenagers (the kids aged up)
- Location: Serves Fulton and DeKalb County, Georgia
- Ratio: Only **1:1 camper-to-counselor ratio** in the Southeast

## My Involvement

### The Commitment
- I serve **every year**
- Same camper for **4 years** now
- That's approximately **one full month** of my life with this kid total
- Not a one-time volunteer thing — ongoing relationship

### The Significance
"I could be the most influential male in this kid's life."

These are children who have no parents. They're in the foster system. The adults they interact with are often temporary — case workers, foster parents who change, institutional staff.

For some of these kids, a consistent male presence who shows up year after year is rare.

## Why This Matters to Me

### Walking the Talk
"Most people talk about change but don't do the work."

This isn't posting about causes on social media. This is showing up, year after year, building a relationship with a child who needs consistency.

### The Long Game
- Not looking for quick wins or credit
- Building something over years
- The impact compounds over time

### What It Teaches Me
- Patience: You can't rush a relationship with a traumatized child
- Consistency: Showing up matters more than grand gestures
- Perspective: My problems are small compared to what these kids face

## Connection to Professional Life

### The Relationship Investment
- Same pattern: People invest in me (MPC, turntables, MixMax opportunity)
- Same approach: I invest in this kid's life
- The through-line: Long-term relationships over transactions

### The Showing Up
- Camp Horizon: Show up every year regardless of what's happening in my life
- Work: The commitment is to "ship first" — showing up with deliverables, not just ideas

### The Humility
- At camp: I'm not the hero; I'm just a consistent presence
- At work: I'm not the genius; I'm the guy who does the work

# TEACHING & COACHING (Gap Year, 2019–2020)

## Special Education Teaching
- Chapel Hill Middle School
- Taught special education during gap year
- Working with high-functioning autistic students (6th–8th grade)
- Required patience, adaptability, individualized approaches

### What It Built
- **Communication skills**: Had to explain things multiple ways
- **Patience**: Progress is slow and non-linear
- **Individualization**: One approach doesn't fit all

## High School Football Coaching
- Chapel Hill High School
- Defensive coach, simultaneous with teaching
- Working with teenagers on teamwork, discipline, skill development

### What It Built
- **Leadership**: Responsible for a group's development
- **Motivation**: Finding what drives different personalities
- **Accountability**: The scoreboard doesn't lie

### Key Takeaway
"You could have a terrible job. And if you're with great people, that job's pretty great as well."

"Definitely the funnest job I've ever had."

## How This Connects

### Teaching → Consultative Sales
- At Biofourmis Inc.: Explaining complex remote monitoring to hospital quality directors
- Same skill: Meeting people where they are, explaining in their language

### Coaching → Team Dynamics
- Understanding what I need from a manager (engaged, not threatened)
- Understanding how I work with peers (need a co-pilot)
- Same skill: Reading people and adapting approach
