# THE 1987 CAMARO IROC-Z

## Why IROC-Z
**Grandfather worked at General Motors** — that's why the IROC-Z happened. It's a family connection.

## The Story
- **Purchase**: Bought for ~$5,000, shipped from Indiana
- **Inspiration**: Watching the opening scene of "Hell or High Water" — the Texas bank robbers were driving an IROC-Z. I'd just sold my vehicle and was ready to buy something
- **Hindsight**: Wouldn't buy that car again — 80s cars have too much plastic on the interior, cracks and breaks everywhere

## What I Actually Did To It
This wasn't a "bought it and drove it" situation. I stripped it to the frame and rebuilt it:

### Mechanical Work
- **Transmission**: Blew the transmission within the first month or two of ownership. Had it rebuilt at AAMCO
- **Fuel system**: Replaced the fuel pump
- **Electrical**: Replaced the alternator
- **Suspension**: Tightened struts
- **Cleaning**: Cleaned all the tar off from the northern town (Indiana rust belt residue)

### Body Work
- **Wreck damage**: Wrecked it, messed up the bumper
- **Strip down**: Stripped the entire car to the frame
- **Fiberglass**: Fiberglassed the bumper
- **Sanding**: Sanded down extensive areas, got it ready for primer
- **Front end**: Took the entire front frame off, front fenders — everything
- **Rust**: Spotted and addressed any rust issues throughout
- **Sound deadening**: Added sound deadening material to interior

### Interior
- **Stereo**: Pulled out the stereo, did interior sound work
- **General**: Various interior restoration work

## What This Shows About Me

### Learning Philosophy
"I learn by taking things apart."

This is how I approach everything — GTM systems, music production, problems. I don't just use something; I need to understand how it works from the inside out. At Biofourmis Inc., I didn't just dial numbers — I reverse-engineered the hospital readmission problem. At MixMax, I wasn't just running campaigns — I was trying to build the whole system from the ground up.

### The Double-Edged Sword
The IROC-Z rebuild illustrates both my strength and my weakness:
- **Strength**: Deep understanding, thorough approach, quality work
- **Weakness**: "You were rebuilding the engine when they needed you to just drive the car"

Sometimes the job is to get it running, not to make it perfect.

# MUSIC: EQUIPMENT & SETUP

## This Is Super Important
You're passionate about music — people should know that. But it's personal, not professional. It's not about asking employers to make beats with you. It's part of who you are.

## The Turntables
**2x Technics SL-1200 MK2**
- The industry standard for DJs and sample-based producers
- One of them is **signed by Slick Rick** (the GOAT)

### How I Got Them
- Found a guy on Facebook Marketplace
- **He fronted them to me** — I signed a contract to pay him back
- This is part of the pattern: people invest in me before I've proven anything

## The MPC
**Akai MPC 2000 XL**
- Classic sampler/sequencer, the backbone of sample-based hip-hop production
- **Cost: $1,000**

### How I Got It
- An **Uber driver bought it for me**
- Didn't even ask for it
- Got my address, shipped it to me
- Just gave it to me

This story sounds unbelievable, but it's true. People see something in me and want to invest.

## The Synthesizer
**Casio synthesizer** (old school model)
- Picked up for about $50
- Adding another texture to the sample-based workflow

## The Workflow
Turntable → MPC → Flip it → Sit with it

This is how the greats created their own sound:
1. Select records (digging)
2. Sample from the turntable
3. Chop and flip in the MPC
4. Sit with it until it's right

# MUSIC: THE COLLECTION

## The Philosophy of Digging

### What Digging Means to Me
"Finding something that a ton of people have heard — or have heard but somehow it's made its way to wax — and finding something there that no one's found. It's been hidden in plain sight."

### The Core Values
- **Diamonds from dirt**: Making something valuable from overlooked material
- **Challenging yourself with limitations**: Working within constraints, not despite them
- **Letting something inspire you**: The sample has to move you enough to create
- **Collaboration across time**: "It takes more than me to create music... it takes the people that made the records before me"

### The Digging Approach
- Budget digging — finding gems for a dollar
- This forces you to sit with music differently
- You can't just skip to the next thing when you're invested
- Geographic limitation shaped what was available to producers historically
- What was in the record store influenced what got sampled

### On Timeless Music
"Timeless music is timeless. You can listen to it a million times and hear something for the first time — or the thousandth time — that you've never heard before."

## The Actual Collection

### Jazz
- **Thelonious Monk — 1965 Bremen, Germany Live** (recent repress)
  - Most expensive and newest record in the collection
  - Monk is foundational — his approach to piano, his use of space

### Soul / Funk / Rock
- **Sly and the Family Stone** — Super important, foundational funk and soul
- **Janis Joplin** — Raw emotion, authenticity, power
- **Isaac Hayes** — Orchestral soul, cinematic production, obvious influence on sampling

### Southern Hip-Hop
- **Goodie Mob** — "So important to me... some of my favorite stuff of all time"
  - Dungeon Family, Atlanta lineage
  - Organized Noize production
  - Soul and substance in Southern rap

- **UGK** — "Some of my favorite music I've ever heard, of all time"
  - Discovered later (didn't know Drake's "Underground Kings" was about them)
  - Pimp C and Bun B
  - Texas sound, authenticity

### East Coast Hip-Hop
- **Gang Starr** — "Early 90s... next level"
  - DJ Premier production
  - Guru's delivery
  - Boom bap foundation

- **Mobb Deep** — "Absolutely legendary"
  - "What they were doing with the little they had"
  - Havoc's production
  - Prodigy's pen
  - Queensbridge sound

### Underground / Alternative Hip-Hop
- **MF DOOM** — Mask, wordplay, production
- **Freddie Gibbs & Madlib** — Modern sampling, lyrical density
- **Cam'ron / Dipset** — Style, charisma, Harlem sound
- **Capone-N-Noreaga** — Queens, gritty, real

### What the Collection Says About Me
"My collection speaks to the explorer I am and the open mind I have when I'm thinking about something. There's always something there, man — it wasn't put on wax for no reason. Somebody thought it was important."

The range — jazz to soul to Southern rap to East Coast boom bap to underground — shows I'm not locked into one lane. I explore. I find connections between things that seem unrelated.

# MUSIC: MY OWN PRODUCTION

## The Journey

### Phase 1: Getting Started
- Started with "light, superficial rap stuff" on a computer
- Got a MIDI keyboard
- Realized: "I can't play instruments"
- Gave myself freedom to create without time limitations

### Phase 2: The Ear Changed
- Struggled through the process of making, mixing, finishing
- Started hearing things differently
- The nuance became apparent
- Developed appreciation for people "penning their own rhymes and really writing"
- Discovered the craft was deeper than I'd understood

### Phase 3: Hardware Transition
- Moved from computer beats to standalone hardware
- Got the Technics turntables
- Got the MPC 2000 XL
- Added the Casio synthesizer
- Now working sample-based, the traditional way

## The Process Now
1. Take something from the turntable
2. Put it in the MPC
3. Sit with it
4. Try to flip it
5. Create something new from the inspiration

## What I Make
- Sample-based production
- Rapping
- Singing choruses
- Whatever it takes to get to the finish line
- "I do whatever"

## The Collaboration Problem
- Tried to get friends involved
- "Nobody really wanted to get super involved or didn't like it like I did"
- Still looking for the right collaborators

## Why I Haven't Released Anything

### It's Not Fear
"I'm not worried about what others think... I know that in order to be great you have to have great taste, and that taste is everything, and I trust my taste."

### It's About Permanence
"I'm not interested in releasing eight singles that have no meaning or aren't tied together or aren't part of a cohesive project. I want to release a project that can be put on wax and be here forever."

### It's About Representation
"I would hate to put something out that wasn't an actual representation of me at the time."

### Music Stays Personal
Music is personal, stays in the lab. It's not part of Lectures From (for now). Different standards apply — artistic integrity over shipping speed.

# THE PATTERN: PEOPLE INVEST IN ME

## Evidence
1. **Marketplace turntable guy**: Fronted me Technics SL-1200 MK2s (one signed by Slick Rick) on a payment plan contract
2. **Uber driver**: Shipped me a $1,000 MPC 2000 XL without me asking
3. **Heath at MixMax**: Gave me the "opportunity of a lifetime" after meeting me in a course
4. **Josh Poppas**: Brought me into consulting work during my gap period
5. **Dr. Kiefer**: Invited me on 270 total days of fieldwork in South America

## What This Means
"That's not luck. That's something about you that makes people want to bet on you. They see the potential. They want to be part of what you're building."

## The Responsibility
People keep betting on me before I've proven anything. That's a gift, but it's also a responsibility. The next opportunity has to be different — not just a better company, but a better me showing up.

# FUTURE PROJECT: DISCOGS API (Not Up Next)
- Set up a query/connection so people can ask about the collection
- Records I have, suggestions, etc.
- Cool addition to the portfolio eventually
- Not a priority right now

# CONNECTION: HOW MUSIC SHOWS UP IN GTM

## Finding What's Hidden in Plain Sight
- **Digging**: Finding the sample no one else found in a common record
- **GTM**: Finding the angle in a "dead" territory (Trace Air: 20 demos from 2,200 contacts)

## Diamonds from Dirt
- **Digging**: Making something valuable from a $1 record
- **GTM**: Building pipeline with no tools, no resources, just creativity

## Challenging Yourself with Limitations
- **Music**: Working with what's in the crate, not unlimited options
- **GTM**: Having 2,200 contacts when peers have 8,800 and still outperforming

## Sitting with Things Until You Hear Them Right
- **Music**: Letting a record reveal itself over days/weeks
- **GTM**: Understanding a market deeply before spraying emails

## It Takes More Than Just Me
- **Music**: Sampling means building on others' work
- **GTM**: Need collaborators, can't do it solo, need a co-pilot
