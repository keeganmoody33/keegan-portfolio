# CAREER ROLES TEMPLATE
## Complete Professional History with PUBLIC & PRIVATE Context

---

# EDUCATION: MERCER UNIVERSITY (May 2019)

## PUBLIC VERSION
**Mercer University | Macon, Georgia | May 2019**
- Summa Cum Laude (highest honors attainable)
- GPA: 3.83
- SGA Senate member
- Extensive community service involvement
- Focus: Biochemistry / Organic Chemistry

## PRIVATE VERSION
Strong academic foundation with leadership and community involvement. The organic chemistry and biochemistry background becomes relevant for understanding the independent research work and the analytical approach to GTM.

# ROLE 1: MEDICAL SCHOOL PIVOT (Pre-Career Decision Point)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Education & Early Career Transition**

- Completed rigorous pre-medical education with strong MCAT performance (99th percentile in Biochemistry and Science sections)
- Accepted to University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (late acceptance)
- Made strategic decision to pivot from clinical medicine to healthcare business and technology after gaining operational exposure at orthopedic practice
- Transitioned scientific training into startup and go-to-market career path
- Foundation in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and research methodology continues to inform analytical approach to business problems

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### Why I Really Left Medicine
I got into Miami medical school on a late acceptance. By that point, I'd already mentally moved on. It wasn't that I turned it down — the timing was just too late. I had already made up my mind to go elsewhere.

### The Barbour Orthopedics Experience
Working at Barbour Orthopedics showed me the business side of healthcare I wasn't aware of. The attention I was paying to how the business operated, how decisions were made — it turned me sour on the healthcare business side. I realized I could impact communities in ways beyond clinical delivery of care.

### How People Reacted
Nobody was tripping about my decision. Everyone was cool. People have always trusted my judgment. I didn't know exactly what I was going to do next, but I felt empowered.

### What It Unlocked
"My education showed me I wasn't really a super academic person before college. Once I understood I could learn anything, accomplish anything, once I broke through that barrier, it opened up so many doors."

This is also when I started making music — the first time I had bandwidth to develop hobbies and explore creatively.

# ROLE 2: CHAPEL HILL (Gap Year, 2019–2020)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Special Education Paraprofessional & Football Coach | Chapel Hill Middle/High School | 2019–2020**

- Special Education Paraprofessional working with high-functioning autistic students (6th–8th grade)
- Developed individualized teaching approaches across multiple subjects: literature, math, history, social skills
- Simultaneously served as Defensive Football Coach for varsity program
- Managed JV game logistics and player development
- Built foundational skills in patience, adaptability, and meeting people where they are

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### The Real Context
This was my planned gap year before medical school. Ended up being a formative experience that taught me more than I expected.

### What It Was Actually Like
- Classroom of about 8 high-functioning autistic boys
- Taught everything — people skills, literature, math, history
- Got stabbed in the back with a pencil once
- Split up fights
- Had terrible days, had amazing days
- Simultaneously coaching football — at practice every day, giving kids rides to school, riding the bus for JV games

### The Key Lesson
"You could have a terrible job. And if you're with great people, that job's pretty great as well."

This was "definitely the funnest job I've ever had." Working with great people is irreplaceable.

# ROLE 3: BARBOUR ORTHOPEDICS (July 2020)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Front Desk Office Associate | Barbour Orthopedics | July 2020 – 2021**

- Managed front desk operations for private orthopedic surgery practice (5 locations in Metro Atlanta)
- Promoted to key holder and staff trainer at Forest Park location
- Processed patient intake documentation and coordinated treatment scheduling
- Developed strong patient-facing customer service skills
- Gained operational understanding of healthcare business administration

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### The Real Experience
Started in July 2020 after COVID hit and my gap year got extended. Eventually ran the front desk at the Forest Park location, had a key, trained new staff.

### What I Actually Did
- Processed all front-end paperwork
- Handled patient intake
- Customer service standout: "I show I care by action. Stand up when someone walks in, hold the door, if they can't get out of the car I go get them, put them in the wheelchair, wheel them in."
- Did the hardest tasks — cleaning toilets, picking up trash, maintaining the office
- Always going above and beyond

### What I Learned
This experience showed me the business side of healthcare I was previously unaware of. The attention to detail I was paying to how the business operated, how decisions were made — it turned me sour on the healthcare business side. I realized I could impact communities in ways beyond clinical delivery of care.

This was a key insight that shaped my pivot away from medicine.

# ROLE 4: BIOFOURMIS INC. (August 2021)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Co-Founding SDR | Biofourmis Inc. | August 2021 – January 2023** *(approximate)*

*Biofourmis Inc. is an artificial intelligence and machine learning healthcare tech company.*

- Co-founding Sales Development Representative for AI/ML digital health unicorn during hypergrowth phase (Series B/C to unicorn status within 8 months)
- Originated Orlando Health partnership deal that has generated $1M+ in revenue and remains active today
- Developed consultative outreach methodology targeting hospital quality assurance directors, focusing on emergency room readmission compliance
- Built systematic process identifying hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission limits and connecting them with remote patient monitoring solutions
- Collaborated directly with C-suite leadership including CCO Shiza Hussein and CTO (Singapore-based)
- Gained deep technical knowledge of healthcare technology stack including Kafka buses, patient/clinician interfaces, and medical data anonymization

**Key Metrics:**
- Originated deal generating $1M+ cumulative revenue (still active)
- 90-day deal cycle (fastest close in company history at that time)
- Led SDR team in results quarter-over-quarter

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### How I Got This Job
Applied cold on LinkedIn. Got interviewed directly by Shiza Hussein, Chief Commercial Officer. My science background (biochemistry, organic chemistry, research, published papers) got their attention.

### What I Actually Did Day-to-Day
- SDR work: generating leads, cold calling, sending sequenced emails through HubSpot
- Using ZoomInfo when it was new and revolutionary
- Had essentially free rein to do whatever I wanted
- Met with technical teams including CTO in Singapore
- Learned about Kafka buses, data pipelines, anonymizing medical IDs
- Essentially a GTM engineer before that title existed

### The Orlando Health Deal
- I originated this deal — it starts with me
- Worked it until finally getting through to the Director of Quality Assurance
- Set up the demo with my AE, Tyler Cole (still there today)
- 90-day cycle — fastest deal the company had ever closed
- I didn't close it — Tyler did — but the origin was mine
- Still generating revenue today, probably over $1M cumulative

### The Metrics Tension
- They expected 80 calls per day
- My process was 20-40 more focused, meaningful calls
- I was leading the team in results quarter-over-quarter
- But I wasn't hitting the daily activity metrics
- The CCO didn't understand what SDR life was like day-to-day
- No intermediate managers to bridge that gap

### Why I Really Left (Fired)
Let go in January despite leading the team in results, despite originating a million-dollar deal. The reason: not hitting activity metrics (80 calls expected, I was doing 20-40).

### The Lesson I Learned (But Didn't Always Apply)
**"Optics are everything."** You can be right and still lose. Document everything. Provide data-driven reasoning. This is not an ego battle.

# ROLE 5: GAP PERIOD (January – July 2023/2024)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Independent GTM Consultant | January 2023 – July 2024** *(approximate)*

- Provided go-to-market strategy consulting for early-stage healthcare technology startups
- Developed outbound sales processes and hospital engagement strategies for BariNav (bariatric surgery software)
- Collaborated with Dr. Mike Blaney (bariatric surgeon, Augusta) and Josh Poppas (former Biofourmis director) on GTM framework development
- Maintained expertise and industry connections while selectively pursuing aligned opportunities

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### The Real Story
I got fired from Biofourmis and didn't land another real opportunity for roughly 18 months.

### How I Survived
- Pushed carts at Home Depot to pay rent
- Did consulting work with Josh Poppas (former Biofourmis mentor)
- Helped Dr. Mike Blaney with Bariatric Centers of America / BariNav
- Built GTM funnel and outbound process for hospital outreach
- $299 contract work — about experience, relationships, potential upside
- That project is still going; I still occasionally help

### My Mindset
I was hustling, motivated, knew I had skills. Refused to take another "smile and dial" metrics-heavy role with no autonomy. Stayed selective — wanted the right opportunity, not just any opportunity.

# ROLE 6: TRACE AIR (SDR Role)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Sales Development Representative | Trace Air | 2024**

- SDR for aerial land development intelligence platform serving construction and real estate markets
- Achieved company-record 20 demos booked in single month, with 18 sourced independently outside existing CRM database
- Developed creative prospecting methodology identifying major land development projects and decision-makers through public records and industry research
- Built greenfield territory from scratch with limited tooling and resources
- First adoption of Clay and video messaging for personalized outreach

**Key Metrics:**
- 20 demos booked (company record for single month)
- 18/20 contacts self-sourced (not in Salesforce)
- Built greenfield territory with only 2,200 contacts vs. peers with 8,800+

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### The Territory Problem
- Assigned a greenfield territory
- My territory: approximately 2,200 contacts
- Another SDR's territory: 8,800 contacts
- Same quota expectations (15 demos/month)
- The SDR before me in this territory had never hit quota

### How I Built My Process
- Started with LinkedIn, manually sending video messages
- Used ChatGPT to find active development projects
- Searched for major developments coming in the next decade
- Found who was running those developments
- Personalized every outreach

### The Record Month
- September: Booked 20 demos (company record)
- 18 of those 20 were contacts NOT in Salesforce — I found them myself
- Proved the territory wasn't dead; the previous approach was wrong

### Why I Left (Fired)
Stood up for the team in a meeting about tools and resources. Manager (Corey) felt threatened, politicked against me. Got fired after being late to a meeting — despite being top performer, despite the record month.

### The Pattern
This is now the second time I've been a top performer and gotten fired anyway because I didn't play the political game.

# ROLE 7: MIXMAX (Founding GTM Engineer)

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)
**Founding GTM Engineer | MixMax | October 2024 – January 2026**

- First dedicated GTM Engineer for Series B sales engagement platform during strategic pivot to AI (MixMax.com → MixMax.ai rebrand November 11)
- Owned complete outbound infrastructure build: domain setup (50+ inboxes), email deliverability, Clay workflows, Smartlead campaigns, targeting/persona development
- Reported directly to CRO with full autonomy over outbound strategy and budget
- Built foundational GTM systems and processes for company's go-to-market engineering function

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

### What Actually Happened
This was different from Biofourmis and Trace Air. At those companies, I was top performer who got fired for politics. At MixMax, I had full autonomy and drowned in it.

- Built frameworks instead of shipping campaigns
- Had full autonomy and didn't deliver — "That's on me"
- Contract ended early (not a firing — contract just ended)

### The Real Problem
I was rebuilding the engine when they needed me to drive the car. Looking for the perfect sample when the job was to press play.

### What I'd Do Differently
- Not worry about perfection
- Do what was suggested/expected initially just to get campaigns out
- Ship and iterate, not build and never launch
- Proactive communication about what I'm DOING, not thinking

---

# THE COMMITMENT (What's Different Now)

## The Operating Principle
**"Ship first. Deliver before it's perfect."**

## What This Means
1. Be proactive about communication and expectations from day one
2. Ship and deliver first — even if it's not perfect
3. Communicate what I'm DOING — not what I'm thinking or brainstorming
4. Accelerate the business in real-time
5. Be dependable — say what I'll do, do it when I said, every time

Simultaneously: Build the swing that elevates multiple teams internally. Bring great ideas to product at all times. Never gatekeep.

# WHAT I ACTUALLY NEED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

## The Right Fit
- **Autonomy with guardrails** — not "do whatever" and not "hit 80 calls or else"
- **Engaged leadership with bandwidth** — someone who can give feedback and check-ins, but not micromanage
- **Clear, time-bound deliverables** — so I don't disappear into framework-building
- **A partner or senior who can translate my ideas when I'm riffing**
- **A creative team with an elite mentor** — someone I can learn from
- **A product I believe in** — I won't work somewhere doing grimy stuff
- **Long-term potential** — I want to level up, get promoted, prove growth within one company

## What I Don't Need
- Pure metrics-driven culture that doesn't value quality
- Complete autonomy with no check-ins
- Managers who feel threatened by capable ICs
- Companies not actually committed to the approach they're hiring for
- Short-term thinking about GTM engineering
