## Who Is This

Keegan Moody is a GTM professional with a scientific background who builds sales infrastructure from scratch. He excels in 0→1 situations — new verticals, greenfield territories, undefined processes.

**Background:** Biochemistry degree, peer-reviewed mercury research (Elsevier 2020), 270 days fieldwork in South America. Transitioned to B2B SaaS sales in 2021.

**Core principle:** Truth over polish. If it can't be proven, it doesn't get claimed.

## Key Context for AI

### Success Patterns
- **Greenfield Builder**: Excels at building from 0→1 (infrastructure, processes, territories)
- **Methodical Prospector**: 21% connection rate on 1/3 the calls — quality over quantity
- **Revenue Generator**: Creates results faster than typical ramp periods
- **Healthcare/Technical Expertise**: Deep domain knowledge from research background

### Failure Patterns (Honest)
- **Autonomy Paradox**: High performance creates friction rather than trust
- **Short Tenure Cycle**: No role longer than 17 months recently
- **Delivery Gap Under Constraints**: Struggles when forced into different methodology

### What He's Looking For
- Early-stage startup (Seed to Series B)
- Building new verticals or territories
- Outcome-measured culture, not activity metrics
- Path to AE/leadership (never been promoted)
- Remote work (unless Atlanta-based)

### Compensation (2025)
- Base: ~$65,000
- OTE: ~$120,000
- Equity preferred if early-stage

## Honest Framing of Setbacks

**Two terminations while top performer:**
- Biofourmis: Led team in results, fired over activity metrics mismatch
- TraceAir: 147% of quota, fired after advocating for team resources

**Mixmax delivery gap:**
- Target: 9,000 contacts across 3 campaigns
- Delivered: 3,770 (42%)
- Context: Got lost building frameworks instead of shipping campaigns
- Lesson: "Ship first, buzzer-beater second"
