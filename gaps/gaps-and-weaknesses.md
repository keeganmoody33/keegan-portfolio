## Skills I'm Still Building

### Enterprise Deal Closing
- **Current state:** Strong at originating and building pipeline. Haven't carried a quota as an AE.
- **Evidence:** Originated Orlando Health ($1M+ LTV), fed 6 AEs across North America
- **Growth path:** Would need mentorship and training to move into closing roles
- **Frame as:** "My strength is top-of-funnel. Closing is the next skill I want to develop."

### Team Management
- **Current state:** Led by influence. Never had direct reports.
- **Evidence:** Advocated for peers, mentored, built processes others used
- **Growth path:** Want to start small and learn
- **Frame as:** "I've led by influence. Ready to grow into formal leadership."

### Formal Sales Methodology
- **Current state:** Self-taught. No MEDDIC, Sandler, Challenger training.
- **Evidence:** Built own prospecting methodologies from scratch
- **Frame as:** "I learned by doing. Open to formal training to fill gaps I don't know I have."

### Deep Technical Engineering
- **Current state:** Can build tools with AI assistance, understand architecture, work with technical teams. Not a production coder.
- **Evidence:** Built portfolio site, JD analyzer, experimenting with APIs
- **Frame as:** "I'm getting more technical every day. Can work alongside engineers, but I'm not one."

## Patterns I've Learned From

### Optics and Communication
- **What happened:** Produced elite results but didn't always manage how it looked. Led to friction in two roles.
- **What I learned:** Results alone aren't enough. How you communicate and navigate matters.
- **What's changed:** More intentional about proactive communication. Document what I'm doing. Pick battles carefully.
- **Frame as:** "I came up as a producer. Now I'm matching that with how I navigate."

### Shipping Speed
- **What happened:** Tendency to build frameworks when the job is to ship campaigns. Got lost in the details at Mixmax.
- **What I learned:** Need engagement to stay on track. Autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me.
- **What's changed:** Operating on "ship first, buzzer-beater second." Asking for clear deadlines and regular check-ins.
- **Frame as:** "I'm a builder. I've learned I need a co-pilot to keep me shipping."

### Short Stints
- **What happened:** Multiple roles under 2 years. Mix of fit issues and lessons learned.
- **What I learned:** Each role taught me more about what I need to thrive. Clearer now about the right setup.
- **What's changed:** More intentional about fit assessment. Know what I need (autonomy + engagement, elite teammates, product-adjacent work).
- **Frame as:** "I've had some short stints. Each one sharpened my understanding of where I thrive. Looking for the right long-term fit."

## What I Need to Thrive

| Need | Why | What Happens Without It |
|------|-----|------------------------|
| Autonomy with engagement | Room to build, but someone engaged to redirect | Too much autonomy = I build forever. Too little = I suffocate. |
| Clear, time-bound deliverables | I need deadlines to ship | Without them, I optimize instead of launch |
| Weekly syncs minimum | Feedback loop keeps me on track | Without check-ins, I go too deep |
| Elite teammates | Sharpened by people better than me | Alone, I lose momentum |
| Product I believe in | I can't fake enthusiasm | Bad fit = can't sell authentically |

## Fit Assessment Guide

### Strong Fit Signals
- Founding/early team role with room to build
- Product-adjacent work (influence on roadmap)
- Engaged leadership with bandwidth for mentorship
- Elite team that collaborates to win
- Clear outcomes with freedom on how to get there

### Caution Signals
- "You'll be completely on your own" (isolation risk)
- Heavy activity metrics without outcome focus
- Scripted execution with no room to experiment
- No senior person to learn from
- Short-term contract with no path forward

### How to Address in Conversation
When these topics come up, don't hide or over-explain. Own it and move forward:

**On short stints:**
> "I've had some short stints. Learned that results alone aren't enough — optics and communication matter too. Each role I've come back sharper. Looking for the right long-term fit where I can grow."

**On weaknesses:**
> "Shipping speed. I tend to build when the job is to launch. I've learned I need engagement and deadlines — autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me. Operating on 'ship first, buzzer-beater second' now."

**On closing experience:**
> "My strength is top-of-funnel — prospecting, ICP development, pipeline generation. I've originated enterprise deals but haven't owned the close. That's the next skill I want to develop."

## The Growth Story

**Old narrative:** "I've been fired twice while being top performer. I didn't deliver at Mixmax. I struggle with optics."

**New narrative:** "I came up producing elite results. Learned that results alone aren't enough — you have to navigate and communicate too. Each role I've gotten sharper. Now I know what I need to thrive: autonomy with engagement, elite teammates, and a product worth building for. Looking for the right long-term fit where I can grow."

Same facts. Different story.
