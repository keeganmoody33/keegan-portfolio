## Part 1: What I Can't Do

### Hard Limitations (Not Learnable in Short Term)

| Limitation | Reality Check |
|------------|---------------|
| **Write production code** | I'm not an engineer. I can work with technical teams, understand architecture, talk about Kafka buses and APIs — but I don't write code. Don't put me in a role where coding is required. |
| **Build in Salesforce/HubSpot backend** | I'm a user, not an admin. I can navigate and report, but I can't architect workflows, build custom objects, or do RevOps work. |
| **Run paid media campaigns** | No experience with Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or performance marketing. Not my lane. |
| **Manage a team (yet)** | I've never had direct reports. I've led by influence and advocated for peers, but I don't have people management experience. |
| **Close enterprise deals solo** | I've originated enterprise deals but never carried a quota as AE or closed myself. Would need significant ramp and training. |
| **Do formal financial analysis** | I can understand SaaS metrics conceptually but can't build financial models, do forecasting, or own budget management. |

### Things I Struggle With (Learnable But Require Effort)

| Weakness | Pattern | What Triggers It |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Shipping speed** | I build frameworks instead of shipping campaigns. I optimize before I validate. | Too much autonomy without deadlines. No one checking on progress. |
| **Optics management** | I've been fired twice while being top performer. I'm right but I lose anyway. | Managers who feel threatened. Environments where perception matters more than results. |
| **Concise communication** | When I'm riffing, I go too long. Ideas get lost. People don't track. | Verbal communication without structure. No time to edit/refine. |
| **Picking battles** | I stand up for myself and my team. Sometimes that creates enemies. | Injustice, gaslighting, managers who don't advocate. |
| **Documentation as I go** | I build in my head and ship, then document after (or not at all). | Fast-moving environments where I'm building constantly. |
| **Focus / monotony tolerance** | I can get bored if I'm not learning new things. Day-to-day repetition wears on me. | Stable, unchanging environments. Same tasks every day. |
| **Remote work discipline** | Struggled with this at Biofourmis. First sales job, learning curve. | No structure, no check-ins, no accountability partner. |

## Part 2: What I Don't Want to Do

### Strong "No" List

| I Don't Want To... | Why |
|--------------------|-----|
| **Smile and dial with no autonomy** | "I refused to get back into metrics-heavy, lack of autonomy roles where I'm just smiling and dialing." I've done this. It doesn't work for me. |
| **Hit arbitrary activity metrics that don't tie to results** | 80 calls/day when 20 focused calls produces better outcomes. I won't grind for optics. |
| **Work for a manager who feels threatened by me** | Happened at Trace Air. Corey didn't like me, felt threatened, politicked against me. I need a secure leader who wants me to win. |
| **Be the only person who understands the system** | At Mixmax, I was building alone. No one could help because no one understood what I was building. That's a trap. |
| **Work somewhere the product is a scam** | Barbour Orthopedics showed me the dark side of healthcare business. I walked away from medical school because of it. I need to believe in what I'm selling. |
| **Work in a purely transactional environment** | I build relationships. I care about the people I'm helping. High-churn, one-call-close environments aren't for me. |
| **Be a cog in a machine** | I need to see how my work connects to outcomes. I need ownership, not just tasks. |

### Soft "No" List (Would Consider for Right Opportunity)

| I'd Prefer Not To... | But I Would If... |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Do pure SDR work again** | The company truly values GTM engineering and the SDR role is a path to ownership |
| **Work in-office full time** | Hybrid with intentional in-person time, or a strong reason to be together |
| **Take a pay cut** | Clear equity upside or exceptional learning opportunity |
| **Join a company stuck at Series B for a decade** | They've genuinely pivoted and have momentum |

## Part 3: Environments I'd Struggle In

### Red Flag Environments

| Environment Type | Why I'd Struggle | Warning Signs |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Metrics theater culture** | I produce results through quality, not volume. If the culture values activity over outcomes, I'll be fired for not playing the game. | "We expect 80 calls/day." "Log everything in Salesforce before you leave." Stack-ranking based on activities. |
| **Full autonomy with no check-ins** | I'll disappear into framework-building. I need someone to redirect me when I'm going too deep. | "You own everything. Figure it out." No weekly syncs. Manager too busy to engage. |
| **No autonomy / heavy micromanagement** | I suffocate without room to think and build. I can't just execute someone else's playbook. | Scripted calls. Mandatory talk tracks. No room to experiment. |
| **Insecure leadership** | If my manager feels threatened by me, they'll find a reason to push me out. Even if I'm the top performer. | Manager who doesn't share credit. Defensive reactions to feedback. Politicking culture. |
| **Broken tools / no resources** | I can build with limited resources, but not with broken systems. Trace Air had tools that didn't work together. | RevOps dysfunction. CRM/sequencer integration issues. "We'll fix it eventually." |
| **No product-market fit** | If the product doesn't solve a real problem, I can't sell it authentically. I need to believe. | High churn. Customers who don't renew. Sales team making promises product can't keep. |
| **Solo operator role with no team** | I need collaboration. "It takes more than me to create." I need people to push against and learn from. | Only GTM hire. No peers. Leadership too busy to engage. |

## Part 4: The Patterns I Need to Break

### Pattern 1: Top Performer, Still Fired

**The pattern:** I produce elite results but get fired for not playing the game.
- Biofourmis: Led team in results, fired for not hitting activity metrics
- Trace Air: 20 demos, 18 self-sourced, fired after standing up for team

**What I'm committing to:**
- Optics matter. Prove things with numbers THEY care about, not just results.
- Fall in line enough to stay employed while I build credibility.
- Pick battles more carefully. Same message, different delivery.

### Pattern 2: Builder Drowns in Autonomy

**The pattern:** Full autonomy leads to framework-building instead of shipping.
- Mixmax: Had everything I wanted. Didn't deliver.

**What I'm committing to:**
- Ship first. Buzzer-beater second.
- Ask for clear, time-bound deliverables.
- Request check-ins even if they don't offer them.
- "Not what I'm thinking, not what I'm brainstorming — but what I'm DOING to accelerate the business."

### Pattern 3: Communication Gets Lost

**The pattern:** When I'm riffing, ideas get lost. People don't track.

**What I'm committing to:**
- Write it down before I say it.
- Lead with the bottom line, then explain.
- Ask: "Is this landing?" and adjust.
- Leave room for others.

### Pattern 4: Standing Up Creates Enemies

**The pattern:** I advocate for myself and my team. Sometimes that creates enemies.
- Trace Air: Called out the gaslighting. Got fired a month later.

**What I'm committing to:**
- Document before escalating.
- Find allies before battles.
- Consider: "Will this change anything, or will it just make me feel better?"
- Learn to let some things go.

## Part 5: What I Need to Succeed

### The Ideal Setup

| Need | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Autonomy with guardrails** | Not "do whatever" and not "hit 80 calls." Clear outcomes with freedom on how to get there. |
| **Engaged leader/mentor** | Someone who has time for me. Weekly syncs at minimum. Feedback, redirection, collaboration. |
| **Clear, time-bound deliverables** | I need deadlines. Without them, I'll build forever. |
| **Creative team** | People to push against. Someone elite to learn from. I don't thrive alone. |
| **Product I believe in** | I can't fake enthusiasm. I need to see real value being delivered. |
| **Path to level up** | I've never been promoted. I want to prove I can grow within a company, not just move to the next one. |

### The Deal-Breakers

| If This Exists... | I Should Walk Away |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Activity metrics that don't tie to outcomes | I'll be fired for not playing the game |
| Manager who seems threatened or defensive | They'll find a reason to push me out |
| "Full autonomy" with no engagement | I'll drown |
| Product that doesn't solve a real problem | I can't sell what I don't believe in |
| No room for creativity or experimentation | I'll suffocate |

## Part 6: Interview Questions I Should Ask

### To Identify Red Flags

- "What does a typical day/week look like for this role?"
- "How do you measure success at 30/60/90 days?"
- "What happened to the last person in this role?"
- "How does the SDR/GTM function interact with leadership?"
- "What tools do I have access to, and who manages them?"
- "How often would I sync with my manager? What does that look like?"
- "What's the biggest challenge the team is facing right now?"
- "How stable is the current GTM strategy?"

### To Identify Good Fit

- "What does success look like for someone who's thriving here?"
- "How much room is there to experiment with new approaches?"
- "Who else is on the team, and what are their strengths?"
- "What's the path from this role to the next level?"
- "How do you give feedback? How often?"
- "What's something the company has changed its mind about recently?"
