## Mixmax (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

**URL:** https://www.mixmax.com

**The Moment:** Sales engagement was in an AI arms race. Every platform was racing to add AI features, but most were bolting on ChatGPT wrappers to existing products. Mixmax made a bold bet — rebuilding as an "AI-native Sales Execution Platform" with three dedicated copilots (Inbox, Meeting, Engagement). Seven years after their last funding round, they needed to prove they could compete with the Outreach and Salesloft giants through product innovation rather than capital.

**The Stakes:** Without fresh funding since 2018, Mixmax had to be efficient. Every GTM dollar mattered. They needed someone who could build the outbound infrastructure from scratch — domains, sequences, prospect databases — without the luxury of a large team or extended runway.

**The Context:** Keegan was brought in as Founding GTM Engineer during this pivotal AI transformation. The role required building 50+ warmed domains, compiling 12,000+ prospect accounts, and creating the Gutenberg playbook framework. The contract ending early (Dec 12 vs. full 3 months) reflects the high-pressure, prove-it-fast startup reality.

## Mobb (May 2025 - Jul 2025)

**URL:** https://mobb.ai

**The Moment:** AI code generation exploded in 2024-2025. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and "vibe coding" became mainstream. But there was a dark side — AI was generating vulnerable code at scale. Security teams couldn't keep up with the backlog. Mobb positioned itself as the antidote: AI that fixes what AI breaks.

**The Stakes:** As a seed-stage startup with $5.4M, Mobb needed to establish market presence quickly. The January 2025 Opengrep consortium launch signaled their commitment to open-source security principles, differentiating from competitors going closed-source.

**The Context:** Keegan joined for a 3-month GTM engagement focused on market research, go-to-market strategy, and business development. The short tenure reflects the contract nature of early-stage startup work — test, learn, iterate.

## TraceAir Technologies (Jun 2024 - Jan 2025)

**URL:** https://www.traceair.net

**The Moment:** Construction tech was finally getting serious adoption. The pandemic had forced builders to embrace remote monitoring, and they weren't going back. TraceAir had just closed a $25M Series B in May 2024, won NAHB Best Software Solution, and had 17 of the top 20 US builders on the platform. Growth was accelerating.

**The Stakes:** Post-Series B meant proving the sales motion could scale. TraceAir needed SDRs who could prospect across multiple states, handle complex enterprise deals, and collaborate with senior AEs on stagnant accounts.

**The Context:** Keegan prospected outbound, inbound, and nurtured accounts across 13 states, yielding $216,437.50 closed-won revenue. In September alone, he booked 22 demos (147% of 15/month quota) with a 21% connection rate vs 4-6% team average. The role demonstrated ability to perform in a scaling sales organization with real revenue targets.

**2025 Update:** In September 2025, TraceAir appointed Ivan Lvov as CEO. The company now has nearly 300 active customers and a global team of 170+.

## Biofourmis (Aug 2021 - Jan 2023)

**URL:** https://biofourmis.com

**The Moment:** Digital health was in a gold rush. COVID had compressed 5 years of telehealth adoption into 18 months. Remote patient monitoring was suddenly mainstream, and CMS was expanding reimbursement. Biofourmis had proven the technology internationally and was betting big on US commercial expansion. They were months away from becoming a unicorn.

**The Stakes:** Breaking into the US hospital market is notoriously difficult — slow procurement cycles, compliance requirements, relationship-driven selling. Federal penalties for ER readmissions were real money — hospitals losing millions. Quality Assurance directors were under pressure to solve this problem.

**The Timeline:**
- **Aug 2021:** Keegan hired as 2nd SDR for Commercial Care vertical
- **Apr 2022:** Biofourmis achieves unicorn status with $300M Series D at $1.3B valuation
- **Aug 2022:** Intel Capital extends Series D by $20M
- **Jan 2023:** Tenure ends

**The Context for Orlando Health:** Keegan's prospecting sourced the Orlando Health deal. AE Tyler Cole closed it in 90 days — the fastest deal in company history. In a market where sales cycles typically run 12-18 months, this velocity proved that Biofourmis could crack the American healthcare market. (Note: SDRs source deals, AEs close them. This distinction matters for honest framing.)

**The Honest Reality:** Despite strong individual performance (top performer), Keegan was terminated. This represents the "autonomy paradox" — high output but friction with organizational structure. This pattern deserves honest framing, not spin.

**2024-2025 Update:** Biofourmis merged with CoPilotIQ in October 2024. Founder Kuldeep Singh Rajput stepped down as CEO after company layoffs (120 employees) and launched OutcomesAI. In January 2025, ActiGraph acquired Biofourmis Connect. The company remains active as a unicorn but has undergone significant restructuring since the 2022 peak funding era.

## Bariatric Centers of America / BariNAV (Jan 2024 - Jun 2024)

**URL:** https://bcofa.com

**The Moment:** The obesity epidemic was driving record demand for bariatric surgery, but surgical programs struggled with patient conversion. Leads would enter the funnel but stall — missing appointments, getting lost in complex pre-operative requirements. The gap between inquiry and surgery was where revenue died.

**The Stakes:** BariNAV was Dr. Mike Blaney's answer — a patient navigation system built by a surgeon who had lived the problem. The product needed to prove it could improve conversion rates for enterprise surgical programs.

**The Context:** Keegan worked as Senior Sales Consultant, collaborating with founders on enterprise sales development and product-market validation. The role bridged sales execution and product feedback in a classic early-stage dynamic.
