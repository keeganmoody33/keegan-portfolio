## BIOFOURMIS_CAREER_NARRATIVE.md

**Source:** Apple Notes (GTME folder)
**Created:** September 26, 2022 (contemporaneous!)
**Canonical file:** `experiences/04-biofourmis.md`

### What Aligns

| Apple Notes | Canonical | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Start: August 2021 | August 2021 | MATCH |
| Team growth to 20+ members | "team scaled to 3 reps" | PARTIAL (different framing) |
| Series D / unicorn status | "unicorn valuation ($1B+)" | MATCH |
| "Led team in meetings per quarter" | "led the team in results quarter over quarter" | MATCH |

### Contradictions (NEED HUMAN INPUT)

#### CONTRADICTION 1: SDR Position
- **Apple Notes (Sep 2022):** "second SDR to join the sales team (8 total)"
- **Canonical (current):** "First SDR hire for Commercial Care vertical"

**Possible resolution:** You were FIRST for Commercial Care vertical, but SECOND SDR overall on the company sales team?

#### CONTRADICTION 2: Team Size Context
- **Apple Notes:** "sales team (8 total at this time)"
- **Canonical:** "team scaled to 3 reps" (SDR team)

**Possible resolution:** 8 = total sales team (SDRs + AEs + leadership), 3 = just SDR team?

### Unique Content to ADD to Canonical

| Content | Source | Value |
|---------|--------|-------|
| "500 daily emails" | Apple Notes | HIGH - specific metric |
| "75 cold calls a week at minimum" | Apple Notes | HIGH - specific metric (vs "80 calls/day expected") |
| "composing marketing emails" | Apple Notes | MEDIUM - shows expanded scope |
| "collaborating with marketing executives" | Apple Notes | MEDIUM - cross-functional work |
| "8 → 20+ sales team" growth trajectory | Apple Notes | HIGH - company growth context |

## TRACEAIR_STATS.md

**Source:** Apple Notes (GTME folder)
**Created:** January 21, 2025 (1 week after departure)
**Canonical file:** `experiences/03-traceair.md`

### What Aligns

| Apple Notes | Canonical | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| First month performance | "record month" narrative | ALIGNS (same event) |

### Discrepancy (NEED HUMAN INPUT)

#### DISCREPANCY: Meeting Count
- **Apple Notes (Jan 2025):** "Booked 22 meetings" (first month)
- **Canonical & other docs:** "20 demos booked"

**Question:** Are "meetings" and "demos" the same metric? Which number is accurate?
- 22 meetings booked → 20 held as demos (2 no-shows)?
- Or one number is simply more accurate than the other?

### Unique Content to ADD to Canonical

| Content | Source | Value |
|---------|--------|-------|
| "21% connection rate" | Apple Notes | HIGH - impressive proof point |
| "4-6% team average" | Apple Notes | HIGH - provides context for outperformance |
| "3.5-5x higher than team average" | Apple Notes | HIGH - quantified multiplier |
| "Made a third of the calls" | Apple Notes | MEDIUM - shows efficiency |

## MIXMAX_CAMPAIGNS.md

**Size:** 549KB (large file)
**Type:** Work product, not narrative
**Action:** Move to `Mixmax/campaigns/` or consolidate key content

This file contains campaign work product from the Mixmax engagement. It's not a narrative document that needs cross-analysis with experiences/ files.

**Recommendation:**
1. Move entire file to `Mixmax/MIXMAX_CAMPAIGNS.md`
2. Or extract key campaign summaries and delete the rest

---

## NOTES_TIMELINE.md

**Type:** Meta-document / index
**Generated:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Useful for reference during cross-analysis

This document maps all Apple Notes by date. After cross-analysis is complete:
- Archive to `outputs/audit/` for reference
- OR delete if `CONTENT_INVENTORY.md` captures the same information
