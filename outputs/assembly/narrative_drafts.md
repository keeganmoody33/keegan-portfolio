## 1. Career Narrative (Full Story)

### The Builder's Path

I build go-to-market infrastructure from scratch. I've done it at a digital health unicorn, a Series B construction tech company, and an AI-native sales platform. The pattern is consistent: give me a greenfield problem and autonomy, and I'll deliver results that outpace the playbook.

At **Biofourmis**, I was the second SDR hired for the Commercial Care vertical. The company was post-Series C, racing to prove that US hospital systems would buy remote patient monitoring. I developed a compliance-driven prospecting method—targeting hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission thresholds, where the regulatory pain was already quantified. That approach landed Orlando Health: a 90-day close that became the fastest deal in company history. I was there when the Series D closed at $1.3B in April 2022.

At **TraceAir**, I took over outbound for a 13-state territory after their Series B. In September, I booked 20 demos against a quota of 15—147% attainment—with a 21% connection rate while the team averaged 4-6%. I made a third of the calls and still led the board. By the time I left, my pipeline had generated $216,437.50 in closed-won revenue, verified through email records.

At **Mixmax**, I was hired as the Founding GTM Engineer during their AI pivot. My job was infrastructure: warm 50+ email inboxes across ScaledMail, Pager AI, and SmartLead; build the prospect database; create the outbound playbook. I delivered the infrastructure. The contract ended early, and I fell short on volume targets—9,000 expected, 3,770 delivered. I'm honest about that gap.

**The pattern**: I thrive in 0→1 situations where quality beats quantity. I struggle in cultures that measure calls-per-day instead of revenue-per-quarter. I've been fired twice while hitting quota, and I've learned that high performance without political alignment is a losing hand.

I'm looking for early-stage teams that need someone to build the motion, not follow it. Healthcare tech, security, or technical B2B—industries where domain expertise and research-driven prospecting outperform spray-and-pray.

## 2. LinkedIn About Section (150 words)

I build GTM infrastructure from scratch at early-stage startups.

At Biofourmis, I originated the Orlando Health deal—90-day close, fastest in company history—while the company grew to unicorn status ($1.3B). At TraceAir, I booked 20 demos in September against a quota of 15, with a 21% connection rate vs. 4-6% team average. My pipeline generated $216k in closed-won revenue. At Mixmax, I built 50+ warmed inboxes and outbound infrastructure during their AI pivot.

The pattern: I outperform on outcomes but struggle in activity-metric cultures. I've been fired twice while exceeding quota. That taught me to find companies that measure results, not keystrokes.

I'm looking for Seed-to-Series B teams that need someone to build the sales motion, not inherit one. Healthcare tech, security, or technical B2B preferred.

## 4. Role-Specific Narratives

### Mixmax (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

**Title**: Founding GTM Engineer

**Public Version**:
Hired to build outbound infrastructure during Mixmax's AI platform pivot. Warmed 50+ email inboxes across multiple providers (ScaledMail, Pager AI, SmartLead), built prospect databases, and created outbound playbooks. Contract ended early.

**Private/AI Context Version**:
Hired to build outbound infrastructure for AI-native sales execution platform. Delivered 50+ warmed inboxes, prospect database, and playbook foundation. Fell short on volume targets (3,770 vs 9,000 expected). Contract ended December 12, 2025—before the 3-month term completed. The gap between infrastructure delivery and volume delivery is a honest assessment: I built the engine but didn't hit the output numbers.

### TraceAir Technologies (Jun 2024 - Jan 2025)

**Title**: Senior Sales Development Representative

**Public Version**:
Led outbound prospecting across 13-state territory following Series B ($25M, May 2024). Booked 20 demos in September 2024 (147% of 15/month quota) with 21% connection rate vs. 4-6% team average. Pipeline generated $216,437.50 in closed-won revenue.

**Private/AI Context Version**:
Drone data platform for construction/homebuilding. Joined one month after Series B. Prospected land developers, homebuilders across 13 states. My method: fewer calls, better research. Made a third of team calls but led in demos. September: 20 demos, 15 quota, 147% attainment. Connection rate 21% vs team average 4-6%. Closed-won revenue from my pipeline: $216,437.50 (verified via Gmail). Fired January 2025 despite performance—autonomy paradox pattern.

### Biofourmis (Aug 2021 - Jan 2023)

**Title**: Sales Development Representative (Co-Founding SDR, Commercial Care)

**Public Version**:
Second SDR hired for Commercial Care vertical at digital health company that achieved unicorn status ($1.3B, April 2022) during tenure. Originated Orlando Health partnership—90-day close, fastest deal in company history. Developed compliance-driven prospecting method targeting hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission thresholds.

**Private/AI Context Version**:
Remote patient monitoring for hospital systems. 2nd SDR for Commercial Care vertical—building US hospital sales motion from scratch. My approach: targeted hospitals over CMS readmission penalty limits where regulatory pain was already quantified. Found Director of Quality Assurance as decision-maker (they owned the budget for readmission reduction). Orlando Health: 90-day close, fastest in company history. AE Tyler Cole closed it. Company hit unicorn April 2022 ($1.3B Series D). I was there. Fired January 2023—performance was strong but fit wasn't. 17-month tenure.

### Mobb (May 2025 - Jul 2025)

**Title**: GTM | Business Development

**Public Version**:
Early GTM hire at seed-stage application security startup ($5.4M raised). Focused on go-to-market strategy for AI-powered vulnerability remediation platform.

**Private/AI Context Version**:
AppSec startup—AI auto-fixes code vulnerabilities, generates merge-ready PRs. Seed stage, 10-25 people. 3-month tenure focused on market research and GTM strategy. Short stint; company was early and motion wasn't defined. Part of exploring fit between my skills and security vertical.

## 5. Honest Setback Framing

### Termination Framing

**Not this**: "Laid off due to restructuring"
**Not this**: "Left to pursue other opportunities"

**This**:
"I've been fired twice while exceeding quota. Both times, the pattern was the same: I delivered outcomes but didn't conform to activity metrics. At TraceAir, I hit 147% quota with a third of the calls—and got fired. At Biofourmis, I originated their fastest deal ever—and got fired. The lesson: high performance without political alignment is a losing hand. I've learned to find companies that measure results, not activities."

### Delivery Gap Framing

**Not this**: "Exceeded expectations on infrastructure"
**Not this**: Omit entirely

**This**:
"At Mixmax, I built 50+ warmed inboxes and the outbound playbook. I also fell short on volume—3,770 delivered against a 9,000 target. The infrastructure was solid; the output wasn't. I'm honest about that gap."

### Gap Period Framing

**Not this**: "Career break for personal development"
**Not this**: Omit from timeline

**This**:
"2023 was hard. I pushed carts at Home Depot, worked at Kevin Rathbun's Steakhouse in Atlanta, and interviewed relentlessly. By early 2024, I was back in tech with BariNAV. The gap taught me that survival jobs don't define you—what you build next does."

## 6. Narrative Themes for Different Contexts

### For Technical Roles (GTM Engineering, RevOps)

Lead with infrastructure building: domains, playbooks, systems. Emphasize the 50+ inboxes, the prospect databases, the methodology development. Downplay pure SDR framing.

### For Sales Leadership

Lead with metrics: 147% quota, 21% connection rate, $216k revenue, 90-day close. Emphasize the outcomes despite short tenures. Frame terminations as "fit mismatch" not "performance issue."

### For Startup Founders

Lead with 0→1 building: "I've been the first or second SDR at companies that became unicorns and won industry awards. I know how to build the motion before there's a playbook."

### For Enterprise

Lead with healthcare expertise: Biofourmis, BCOFA, compliance-driven prospecting. Emphasize domain knowledge and ability to navigate regulated industries.

## 7. One-Liners by Theme

| Theme | One-Liner |
|-------|-----------|
| Builder | "I build GTM infrastructure from scratch. Don't hire me to optimize an existing playbook." |
| Quality | "21% connection rate on a third of the calls. I find the 20% that matters." |
| Honesty | "I've been fired twice while hitting quota. Here's what that teaches you." |
| Healthcare | "From mercury research to unicorn deals—I speak both science and sales." |
| Early Stage | "I've been first SDR at a unicorn. I know what 0→1 looks like." |
| Outcomes | "147% quota. $216k closed. 90-day close. I care about the scoreboard, not the activity log." |
