## The Builder's Path

I build go-to-market infrastructure from scratch. Not campaigns—*systems*. The methodology, the automation, the intelligence layer that makes outbound repeatable. I've done it at a digital health unicorn, a Series B construction tech company, and an AI-native sales platform.

The pattern is consistent: give me a greenfield problem and autonomy, and I'll build something that outlasts my tenure. The infrastructure I leave behind is the proof.

## Mixmax (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

**Role**: Founding GTM Engineer
**Context**: Series B company ($22M raised). Running on inbound for 1+ year. No outbound motion. No validated ICP.

This was the most comprehensive work of my career.

### What I Built

**Infrastructure**
- Warmed 50+ email inboxes across ScaledMail, Pager AI, and SmartLead AI
- Created modular email A/B/C testing framework—separating sequences into reusable components (openings, problems, social proof, CTAs) for isolated variable testing at scale
- Designed phased testing methodology: opening hooks → problem angles → social proof types → CTA styles

**Intelligence System**
- Validated their entire 280-customer base ($4.79M ARR) using "The Volley Method"—bidirectional validation between quantitative customer data and qualitative case study narratives
- Discovered power law revenue distribution: 15% of accounts generate 66% of revenue
- Identified 51-200 employee segment as the sweet spot—2x the ARR of smaller bands, 23% of the customer base
- Processed 445 raw case study entries into 43 structured profiles with usage classifications (KEEP, KEEP WITH CAVEATS, DEMOTE)
- Built Golden Goose scoring model (100-point, 6-factor weighting) producing 4-tier customer segmentation: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze

**Automation Architecture (Gutenberg Framework)**
- Designed 9-agent autonomous sales execution system:
  - **List Builder**: Sources 100K+ contacts with intent signals
  - **Data Quality Engineer**: Verifies/cleans to 40K-50K qualified
  - **Offer Strategist**: Creates 15-20 message/offer combinations
  - **Campaign Orchestrator**: Tests combinations, identifies winners
  - **Deliverability Engineer**: Maintains >90% inbox placement
  - **Analytics Optimizer**: Scales winners, runs optimization loops
  - **Market Intelligence**: Detects buying signals from job postings
  - **Competitive Intelligence**: Extracts competitor displacement contacts
  - **ICP Intelligence**: Pattern analysis and targeting refinement

**Methodology & Documentation**
- Authored 30+ strategic documents with provenance tracking—every statistic traces to a source
- Developed "The Volley Method" for ICP validation (transferable to any B2B company)
- Created tacit knowledge extraction framework—surfacing unstated buying triggers and failure conditions from customer stories
- Built Context Engine architecture—document-based knowledge graph with reconciliation protocols and dependency management

### What I Discovered

- **The ICP Paradox**: Targeting parameters optimized for account volume do NOT optimize for revenue capture
- **Universal Buyer Mechanism**: "Coordination latency and visibility gaps in high-volume asynchronous outreach"—the actual problem customers are solving regardless of how they articulate it
- **Cross-Vertical Transferability**: The mechanism transfers to recruiting, real estate, healthcare, legal, and education when 5+ contextual factors co-occur
- **Dual-Motion Strategy**: Volume motion (51-200 employees) + Value motion (201-1000) + Enterprise opportunistic (1000+)

### The Honest Assessment

**Mission**: $300K revenue by January 15, 2026
**Contract ended**: December 12, 2025 (early)
**Volume targets**: 3,770 delivered vs 9,000 expected

Did I take it from 0 to 100? No. But I built the foundation—validated ICP, proven methodology, production-ready infrastructure—and documented everything with source attribution. The system works. I didn't finish running it.

## TraceAir Technologies (Jun 2024 - Jan 2025)

**Role**: Senior Sales Development Representative
**Context**: Series B ($25M, May 2024). Drone data platform for construction/homebuilding. 13-state territory.

### What I Did

My method: fewer calls, better research. I made a third of the team's calls but led in demos.

**September 2024**: 22 demos booked against 15/month quota—**147% attainment**—with a 21% connection rate while the team averaged 4-6%.

By the time I left, my pipeline had generated **$216,437.50 in closed-won revenue** (verified via Gmail).

### The Pattern

High performance, short tenure, termination despite metrics. This is when the "autonomy paradox" became undeniable—quality-over-quantity approaches conflict with activity-metric cultures.

## Biofourmis (Aug 2021 - Jan 2023)

**Role**: Sales Development Representative (Co-Founding SDR, Commercial Care)
**Context**: Digital health unicorn. Post-Series C, racing to prove US hospital systems would buy remote patient monitoring.

### What I Did

I was the 2nd SDR hired for the Commercial Care vertical—building the US hospital sales motion from scratch.

I developed a compliance-driven prospecting methodology: targeting hospitals exceeding federal CMS readmission penalty thresholds, where the regulatory pain was already quantified. Found the Director of Quality Assurance as the decision-maker—they owned the budget for readmission reduction.

**Orlando Health**: My prospecting sourced the deal. AE Tyler Cole closed it. 90-day close—fastest in company history.

I was employed during the Series D ($1.3B valuation, April 2022). The company achieved unicorn status while I was there.

### The Pattern (Again)

17 months—my longest recent tenure. Terminated despite originating the flagship deal. The autonomy paradox: high performance without political alignment is a losing hand.

---

## The Pattern

I thrive in 0→1 situations where quality beats quantity. I struggle in cultures that measure calls-per-day instead of revenue-per-quarter.

I've been fired twice while hitting quota:
- **TraceAir**: 147% attainment—fired
- **Biofourmis**: Sourced fastest deal in company history—fired

The lesson: high performance without political alignment is a losing hand. I've learned to find companies that measure results, not activities.

---

## What I'm Looking For

**Company stage**: Seed to Series B
**Environment**: High autonomy, outcome-measured, greenfield opportunity
**Industry**: Healthcare tech, security, or technical B2B SaaS
**Role**: GTM Engineer, Founding SDR/AE, or Revenue Operations

I want to build the motion, not follow it.
