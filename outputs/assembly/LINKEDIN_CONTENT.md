## About Section (Primary - 200 words)

I build GTM intelligence systems from scratch at early-stage startups.

At Mixmax (Series B, $22M raised), I was hired to build outbound infrastructure for a company that had been running on inbound for over a year. What I actually built was an **enterprise-grade GTM intelligence system**:

**The Data Infrastructure**:
- Validated 402 customer accounts ($4.79M ARR) through bidirectional methodology
- Built statistical validation pipeline that identified 5 critical issues blocking GTM execution
- Created Context Engine architecture—a knowledge graph for all GTM intelligence

**The Strategic Analysis**:
- Discovered power law revenue distribution: 14.7% of accounts generate 66.2% of revenue
- Identified the actual buying trigger: "capacity amplification during growth inflection points"—not the features customers say they want
- Designed dual-motion GTM strategy: Volume (51-200 employees) + Value (201-1000) + Enterprise opportunistic

**The Operational Output**:
- 62 competitors analyzed across 27 categories
- Prospecting parameters with validated search syntax
- SDR/AE activation playbooks with expected response rates by tier
- CRO Package for executive decision-making

Did I hit the $300K revenue target? No. But I built the intelligence layer that makes revenue generation repeatable—and documented everything with source attribution.

## About Section (Compact - 150 words)

I build GTM intelligence systems at early-stage startups.

At Mixmax, I built more than outbound infrastructure—I built an **enterprise-grade intelligence system**:

- Validated 402 customers ($4.79M ARR) through bidirectional methodology
- Discovered power law: 14.7% of accounts = 66.2% of revenue
- Identified the real buying trigger (not what customers say, what they actually need)
- Designed dual-motion GTM strategy with statistical backing
- Analyzed 62 competitors across 27 categories
- Created Context Engine architecture—knowledge graph for GTM intelligence
- Built CRO Package for executive decision-making

Before that: sourced the fastest deal in Biofourmis history (90-day close). At TraceAir: 147% quota, $216k revenue while making 1/3 of team calls.

I build the intelligence layer that makes revenue repeatable. Looking for Seed-to-Series B teams who need GTM infrastructure, not just campaigns.

## About Section (Technical - 175 words)

I build GTM data infrastructure and intelligence systems.

At Mixmax, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of 402 customer accounts ($4.79M ARR) that produced:

**Statistical Validation**:
- ICP Validation Audit identifying 5 critical issues and 6 validated findings
- Power law confirmation: top 59 accounts (14.7%) generate $3.4M (66.2% of revenue)
- Employee band economics proving 51-200 segment delivers 2x ARR of smaller bands

**System Architecture**:
- Context Engine—document-based knowledge graph with reconciliation protocols
- Golden Goose scoring model (100-point, 6-factor weighting)
- 9-agent Gutenberg Framework for autonomous sales execution
- Email variance testing framework with modular A/B/C methodology

**Strategic Outputs**:
- Dual-motion GTM strategy: Volume + Value + Enterprise tracks
- Competitive intelligence on 62 players across 27 categories
- Prospecting parameters with buying triggers and search syntax
- SDR/AE activation playbooks with performance benchmarks

**The Key Discovery**: Customers aren't buying features—they're buying "capacity amplification during growth inflection points."

Honest assessment: Built the intelligence layer. Didn't hit the revenue target. The system works.

## Experience Bullets

### Mixmax — Founding GTM Engineer (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

**The Context**: Series B company ($22M raised) running on inbound for 1+ year. No outbound motion. No validated ICP. No statistical foundation for GTM decisions.

**What I Built**:

*Data Infrastructure*
- Validated 402 customer accounts representing $4.79M ARR through bidirectional methodology ("The Volley Method")
- Built statistical validation pipeline that identified 5 critical issues blocking GTM execution and 6 validated findings confirming data integrity
- Created Context Engine architecture—document-based knowledge graph with reconciliation protocols and dependency management
- Processed 445 case study entries into 43 structured profiles with usage classifications

*Statistical Analysis*
- Discovered power law revenue distribution: top 59 accounts (14.7%) generate $3.4M (66.2% of total revenue)
- Validated employee band economics: 51-200 segment delivers $12,674 average ARR (2x smaller bands)
- Identified 31.8% data coverage gap in employee counts affecting $470K ARR—recommended $6,500 enrichment investment with 100x ROI projection
- Proved ICP paradox: targeting parameters optimized for volume do NOT optimize for revenue capture

*Strategic Framework*
- Designed dual-motion GTM strategy: Volume motion (51-200) + Value motion (201-1000) + Enterprise opportunistic (1000+)
- Identified the actual buying trigger: "capacity amplification during growth inflection points" (not the features customers articulate)
- Built 10-part Strategic Insights document with revenue optimization roadmap
- Created CRO Package for executive decision-making with recommended reading order

*Competitive Intelligence*
- Analyzed 62 competitors across 27 subcategories
- Mapped competitive threat matrix: 3 direct platform, 7 convergent, 4 in-inbox, 10 CRM suite, 15 adjacent partners
- Identified key displacement targets: Outreach, SalesLoft, Groove (primary); HubSpot, Lemlist (awareness)

*Operational Infrastructure*
- Warmed 50+ email inboxes across ScaledMail, Pager AI, SmartLead AI
- Designed 9-agent Gutenberg Framework for autonomous sales execution
- Built email variance testing framework with modular A/B/C methodology
- Created SDR/AE activation playbooks with expected response rates by tier (Ideal: 20%+, Good: 12%+, Monitor: 5%+)

*Documentation*
- Authored 30+ strategic documents with provenance tracking—every statistic traces to source
- Created CORRECTED_STATISTICS_QUICK_REFERENCE for validated claims
- Built DATA_QUALITY_CERTIFICATION for agent-ready data packages

**The Honest Assessment**:
- Mission: $300K revenue by January 15, 2026
- Contract ended: December 12, 2025 (early)
- Delivered: Infrastructure foundation, intelligence system, strategic framework
- Didn't deliver: Revenue target (3,770 contacts delivered vs 9,000 expected)
- The system works. I didn't finish running it.

- Pattern recognition across roles
- Fit mismatch between autonomous work style and activity-metric culture
- How to identify companies that measure outcomes, not activities

## Talking Points (Verified from Source)

**Use these exact phrasings (validated statistics)**:

1. "Validated 402 customer accounts representing $4.79M ARR"
2. "Power law: 14.7% of accounts generate 66.2% of revenue ($3.4M)"
3. "51-200 employee segment delivers 2x the average ARR ($12,674 vs $6,306)"
4. "Identified 5 critical issues blocking GTM execution"
5. "62 competitors analyzed across 27 subcategories"
6. "The actual buying trigger: capacity amplification during growth inflection points"
7. "Dual-motion GTM strategy: Volume + Value + Enterprise tracks"

**Do NOT say**:

- "Built a $300K pipeline" (didn't hit revenue target)
- "280 customers" when you mean "402 accounts" (different datasets)
- "Led GTM team" (was solo contributor)
- "Closed deals" at Biofourmis (sourced, not closed—SDR role)

## Key Differentiators

**What makes this work different**:

1. **Statistical Rigor**: Every claim traces to validated source data
2. **Enterprise-Grade Documentation**: CRO Package, audit reports, quality certifications
3. **Transferable Methodology**: The Volley Method, Tacit Knowledge Extraction work at any B2B company
4. **Honest Assessment**: Clear about what was delivered and what wasn't
5. **System Thinking**: Built infrastructure, not just campaigns
