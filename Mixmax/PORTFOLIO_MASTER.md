## Executive Summary

As the **founding GTM engineer** at Mixmax.ai (Series B), I was brought in to build outbound sales capability from scratch. The company had been sustaining on inbound and existing customers for over a year with no systematic outbound motion. Over a 3-month engagement, I designed and built a complete **Go-To-Market Intelligence System** from the ground up. This portfolio documents the methodologies, systems, and artifacts created - demonstrating competencies in:

- **AI/ML Agent System Architecture** - 9 specialized autonomous agents
- **Data Engineering & Pipeline Design** - ETL pipelines processing 280+ customer records
- **Sales Operations Strategy** - ICP validation, scoring models, competitive intelligence
- **Email Infrastructure & A/B Testing** - Modular variance testing framework
- **Technical Documentation** - 30+ strategic documents with knowledge management systems

**Total Impact**: Production-ready system with 150+ artifacts, $4.79M ARR customer base analyzed, and transferable methodology applicable to any B2B SaaS company.

## Project Overview

### The Challenge

Mixmax, a Series B sales engagement platform, had been operating without outbound sales for over a year - sustaining on inbound leads and existing customer expansion. As the founding GTM engineer, I was tasked with building the outbound infrastructure from zero. The company needed to:
- Validate their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) with data-driven analysis
- Build systematic outbound sales execution capability
- Extract actionable intelligence from 445 raw case study entries (processed into 43 structured profiles)
- Create reproducible processes for GTM operations

### The Solution

I built a comprehensive **GTM Intelligence System** consisting of:

| Component | Description | Key Deliverable |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **ICP Validation Engine** | Customer analysis & scoring | 280 validated customers, Golden Goose scoring |
| **9-Agent GTM System** | Autonomous sales execution | Gutenberg Framework implementation |
| **Email Variance Framework** | Systematic A/B/C testing | Modular email assembly system |
| **Case Study Intelligence** | Structured messaging data | 43 extracted case study profiles |
| **Code Quality Governance** | Repository maintenance | 2 specialized audit agents |

### Technology Stack

```
Languages:        Python 3.x, SQL, Markdown
Data Processing:  Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter
AI/ML:            Claude API (Anthropic), LLM Prompt Engineering
Tools:            Clay (enrichment), ZeroBounce/NeverBounce (verification)
Infrastructure:   Git, JSON, CSV data pipelines
Frameworks:       Claude Code SDK, MCP (Model Context Protocol)
```

## Key Achievements

### 1. Built 9-Agent Autonomous Sales System
Designed and implemented the **Gutenberg Framework** - a systematic 6-step outbound methodology executed by 9 specialized AI agents working in coordination.

**Agents Created:**
- List Builder (100K+ contact sourcing)
- Data Quality Engineer (verification & cleanup)
- Offer Strategist (15-20 message/offer combinations)
- Campaign Orchestrator (testing & winner identification)
- Deliverability Engineer (>90% inbox placement)
- Analytics Optimizer (scaling & continuous improvement)
- Market Intelligence (buying signal detection)
- Competitive Intelligence (displacement targeting)
- ICP Intelligence (pattern analysis & scoring)

**[Detailed Documentation →](./portfolio/ARTIFACT_GTM_AGENTS.md)**

---

### 2. Validated $4.79M ARR Customer Base
Analyzed 280 paying customers to extract ICP patterns, validate assumptions, and create data-driven targeting criteria.

**Key Findings:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 51-200 employees (22.64% of accounts, 22.28% of ARR)
- **Power Law**: Top 59 accounts (14.7%) generate 66.2% of revenue
- **Tech Stack Signal**: Gmail + CRM = strongest predictor of success
- **Industry Focus**: Software/SaaS, Technology, IT Services

**[Detailed Documentation →](./portfolio/ARTIFACT_ICP_INTELLIGENCE.md)**

---

### 3. Created Golden Goose Scoring Model
Developed a 100-point customer scoring framework incorporating both firmographic and behavioral signals.

**Scoring Components:**
| Factor | Max Points | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| ARR Tier | 25 | Revenue = value proxy |
| Renewal Count | 20 | Loyalty indicator |
| Employee Band | 15 | ICP fit |
| Seat Adoption | 15 | Product-market fit signal |
| Multi-tier Usage | 10 | Expansion potential |
| Tech Stack | 10 | Integration readiness |

**Output:** 4 customer tiers (Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze) with actionable prospecting lists.

---

### 4. Built Modular Email Variance Testing System
Designed a systematic A/B/C testing framework that separates email components into reusable modules.

**Architecture:**
- `modules.json` - Reusable text blocks (openings, problems, social proof, CTAs)
- `test_config.json` - Test matrix defining variant combinations
- `assemble_emails.py` - Generator producing personalized 5-email sequences

**Testing Phases:**
1. Opening hooks (question vs statement vs observation)
2. Problem angles (fragmentation vs execution vs prioritization)
3. Social proof types (customer names vs stats vs stories)
4. CTA styles (soft exit vs redirect vs demo)

**[Detailed Documentation →](./portfolio/ARTIFACT_EMAIL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)**

---

### 5. Extracted Intelligence from 445 Case Studies
Processed raw case study data into 43 structured profiles with extracted pain points, solutions, and results.

**Methodology:**
- Signal extraction (pain points, buying triggers, objections)
- Sub-industry and size-bucket classification
- Role-based needs mapping
- Tacit knowledge identification (unstated assumptions, prerequisites)

**Output:** `social_proof_library.json` with segment-matched case studies for personalized messaging.

---

### 6. Established Code Quality Governance
Created 2 specialized agents for ongoing repository maintenance:

**Inspector Butters** - Senior code review using 6-pass methodology:
1. Architecture & Design
2. Logic & Flow
3. Error Handling
4. Security & Safety
5. Performance & Resources
6. Maintainability & Clarity

**Relevance Auditor** - File validation against project canon:
- Mission alignment testing
- Data currency verification
- Structural integrity checks
- Escalation protocols

## Transferable Methodologies

### The "Volley Method" (Dual-Source Validation)
Alternates between quantitative customer data and qualitative case study narratives to produce higher-confidence findings. Neither source alone reveals the complete picture - volleying between them surfaces insights invisible to single-source analysis.

### Tacit Knowledge Extraction Framework
3-phase methodology for surfacing implicit knowledge from case studies:
1. **Explicit signals** - Stated pain points, solutions, results
2. **Implicit patterns** - Unstated assumptions, prerequisites
3. **Purchase mechanisms** - Buying triggers, objection handling

### Context Engine Architecture
Document-based knowledge graph enabling both human operators and AI agents to consume structured intelligence consistently. Includes reconciliation protocols, provenance tracking, and dependency management.

### Golden Goose Scoring
Multi-factor customer scoring combining firmographic data (company size, industry, tech stack) with behavioral signals (renewals, seat adoption, multi-tier usage) to identify highest-value lookalike prospects.

## Lessons Learned & Reflections

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Documentation Consistency from Day One**: Some supporting documents (CRO memos, GTM system docs) were created iteratively during the engagement with varying timestamp formats and date references. In retrospect, establishing a documentation standard upfront would have prevented minor inconsistencies across the 30+ files.

2. **Industry Enrichment Earlier**: With only ~5% industry coverage in the customer data, I couldn't implement vertical-specific playbooks. Investing $1-2K in Clay industry enrichment in Week 1 would have unlocked segment-specific targeting.

3. **Win/Loss Tracking**: All 43 case studies represent successful customers (survivorship bias). Building systematic win/loss capture from the start would have validated competitive positioning assumptions.

4. **Scoring Model Ceiling**: The Golden Goose V1 model maxed at 65% because 2 of 6 components weren't implemented. I should have documented this limitation more prominently from the start rather than discovering it during analysis.

### What Worked Well

- **The Volley Method** (alternating quantitative/qualitative analysis) produced higher-confidence findings than either source alone
- **Explicit provenance tracking** for all statistics prevented "ghost statistics" from propagating
- **Agent specialization** (9 agents vs 1) enabled clear responsibility boundaries and handoff protocols
