## Summary

**GTM Engineer**

Most recently at Mixmax (Series B), where I was the first GTM engineering hire. The company had been running on inbound for over a year—I came in to build outbound infrastructure from scratch.

**What I worked on:**
- 50+ warmed inboxes and campaign deployment infrastructure
- Email sequence system with modular A/B/C testing
- Customer analysis across 280 accounts ($4.79M ARR) to validate ICP assumptions
- Internal tools for sales asset management
- Knowledge system for extracting tacit knowledge from customer stories—the unstated buying triggers and failure conditions that don't show up in case studies—to match the right proof to the right prospect

Did I take it from 0 to 100? No. But I built the foundation and learned a lot about what it actually takes to operationalize outbound at a company that's never had it.

**What I'm working on now:**
Getting better at communication and organization. Applying systems thinking to GTM problems. Understanding why some companies crack repeatable revenue and others don't.

**What I'm interested in:**
The intersection of GTM and product. If you're building something in this space—or just want to talk go-to-market—I'd love to connect.
