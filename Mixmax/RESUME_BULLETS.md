## High-Impact Summary Bullets (Pick 2-3)

- Built complete [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM|Go-To-Market intelligence system]] from zero for Series B company with no outbound motion for 1+ year, delivering validated [[ARTIFACT_ICP_INTELLIGENCE|ICP]], [[ARTIFACT_GTM_AGENTS|9-agent automation framework]], and production-ready prospecting infrastructure in 3 months

- Designed and implemented [[ARTIFACT_GTM_AGENTS|9-agent autonomous sales execution system]] ([[CLAUDE|Gutenberg Framework]]) enabling systematic testing of 15-20 message/offer combinations across 100K+ contacts to identify winners at 2-4% reply rates

- Validated [[MIXMAX_ICP_MASTER|$4.79M ARR customer base]] (280 accounts), discovering [[CORRECTED_STATISTICS_QUICK_REFERENCE|51-200 employee segment]] delivers 2.6x higher ARR than smaller bands, redirecting company's targeting strategy from volume to [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#Part 4 Recommendations|dual-motion GTM]]

---

## AI/ML & Agent Systems

- Architected [[ARTIFACT_GTM_AGENTS|9 specialized AI agents]] with defined [[AGENT_INTERACTION_FLOW|handoff protocols]], emergency procedures, and feedback loops for end-to-end outbound sales automation (list building → verification → testing → scaling)

- Developed [[ARTIFACT_GTM_AGENTS#Agent Orchestration|multi-agent orchestration system]] processing 100K+ raw contacts through verification pipeline (60% pass rate) to 40K-50K qualified prospects with [[ARTIFACT_ICP_INTELLIGENCE#Golden Goose Scoring Model|tiered quality scoring]]

- Created [[AGENT_INTERACTION_FLOW#Handoff Protocols|agent coordination framework]] with 6 handoff stages, quality gates, and continuous optimization loops achieving systematic winner identification in <14 days

---

## Data Engineering & Analytics

- Built [[ARTIFACT_DATA_ENGINEERING|ETL pipeline]] merging [[CURRENTCUSTOMERS_CLAYENRICHED|Clay enrichment]] and [[CURRENTCUSTOMERS_SALESFORCEDIRECT|Salesforce CRM]] data for 400+ customer records with automated conflict resolution, deduplication, and [[DATA_QUALITY_CERTIFICATION|quality certification]]

- Developed [[ARTIFACT_ICP_INTELLIGENCE#Golden Goose Scoring Model|100-point Golden Goose customer scoring model]] combining firmographic (ARR, size, tech stack) and behavioral signals (renewals, seat adoption), producing [[golden_goose_enhanced_v2|4-tier classification system]] for prospect prioritization

- Processed [[ARTIFACT_ICP_INTELLIGENCE#Case Study Intelligence|445 raw case study entries into 43 structured profiles]] using [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#22 Tacit Knowledge Extraction Framework|tacit knowledge extraction framework]], enabling segment-matched messaging with [[social_proof_library|signal-based personalization]]

- Discovered [[STRATEGIC_INSIGHTS_DEEP_ANALYSIS|power law revenue distribution]] (top 15% of accounts = 66% of revenue), informing strategic shift from volume-based to dual-motion GTM approach

---

## Sales Operations & Strategy

- Identified [[CORRECTED_STATISTICS_QUICK_REFERENCE|ICP sweet spot]] (51-200 employees) representing 23% of accounts with $12,674 average ARR—2x the value of smaller segments—validating data-driven targeting over assumptions

- Mapped [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#35 Competitive Landscape|62 competitors across 27 categories]], establishing primary displacement targets (Outreach, SalesLoft, Groove) with [[competitive-intelligence|competitive intelligence playbooks]]

- Created [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#41 Dual-Motion GTM Strategy|dual-motion GTM strategy]]: volume motion (51-200 employees), value motion (201-1000), and enterprise opportunistic (1000+) based on validated revenue concentration analysis

- Established [[CLAUDE#Performance Thresholds|performance thresholds]] and classification system: GOLD (>4% reply), WINNER (2-3%), DEAD (<1% - kill immediately) for systematic campaign optimization

---

## Email & Marketing Automation

- Designed [[ARTIFACT_EMAIL_INFRASTRUCTURE|modular A/B/C email testing framework]] separating sequences into reusable components ([[modules|openings, problems, social proof, CTAs]]) for isolated variable testing at scale

- Built [[assemble_emails|Python email generator]] with round-robin variant assignment processing lead lists through automatic personalization and 5-email sequence assembly

- Implemented [[ARTIFACT_EMAIL_INFRASTRUCTURE#Testing Strategy|phased testing methodology]]: opening hooks → problem angles → social proof types → CTA styles, enabling statistically valid winner identification

---

## Technical Documentation & Systems

- Authored [[PORTFOLIO_MASTER#Portfolio Artifacts|30+ strategic documents]] with provenance tracking, preventing "ghost statistics" and ensuring all claims trace to [[CORRECTED_STATISTICS_QUICK_REFERENCE|validated source data]]

- Developed [[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#24 Context Engine Architecture|Context Engine architecture]]—document-based knowledge graph with reconciliation protocols, dependency management, and automated freshness monitoring

- Created [[ARTIFACT_CODE_GOVERNANCE|2-agent code governance system]]: [[inspector-butters|Inspector Butters]] (6-pass senior code review) and [[relevance-auditor|Relevance Auditor]] (5-test file validation against project canon)

- Designed transferable methodology ([[GTM_INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM#21 The Volley Method|The Volley Method]]) for ICP validation applicable to any B2B SaaS with customer data and success narratives
