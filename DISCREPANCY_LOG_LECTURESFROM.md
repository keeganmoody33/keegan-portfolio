## Notes

1. **TraceAir End Date**: Some sources show December 17, 2024, others show January 2025. Used January 2025 as the end date with note that final pay was December 31, commissions paid January 15.

2. **Email Address**: Two emails found in workspace (keeganmoody@gmail.com and keeganmoody33@gmail.com). User confirmed keeganmoody33@gmail.com as primary.

3. **Inbox Count**: Document originally said "53 inboxes" but verified sources consistently say "50+ warmed inboxes" or "50+ warmed sending domains." Used conservative "50+" phrasing.

4. **Compendium Pages**: Document said "65-page" but verified sources say "30+ strategic documents." Used verified phrasing.

5. **GitHub URL**: github.com/keeganmoody33 - Unable to verify if public profile exists. Kept as-is in document with note to verify. May be private account or not yet created.
