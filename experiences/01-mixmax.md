## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Founding Go-To-Market Engineer

**Summary:**
Architected the outbound motion at Mixmax from the ground up. Series B company operating on a PLG model—product-qualified leads and individual users converting to B2B team accounts—with no systematic outbound for over a year. Worked directly with the CRO daily, collaborated closely with RevOps, and built the infrastructure, intelligence systems, and methodology required to run campaigns at scale. Ran 4+ campaigns and trained the RevOps team on execution. Contributed to the Mixmax.com → Mixmax AI rebrand (November 2025).

**What I Built:**

**Outbound Infrastructure:**
- 53-inbox architecture across ScaledMail and SmartLead with deliverability safeguards, warm-up protocols, and multi-provider diversification
- End-to-end tech stack integration: Clay → Octave → SmartLead → HeyReach—from targeting through multi-channel execution
- Campaign testing framework with defined kill/scale thresholds (>4% reply rate = scale, <1% = kill)

**9-Agent AI Orchestration System:**
- Designed autonomous agent architecture in Claude Code and Cursor with specialized agents for list building, data quality engineering, offer strategy, campaign orchestration, deliverability optimization, analytics, market intelligence, competitive intelligence, and ICP refinement
- Agent handoff protocols and feedback loops enabling systematic testing of 15-20 message/offer combinations
- System outputs designed to be immediately actionable by SDRs—production-ready campaign packages

**ICP Intelligence:**
- Analyzed 280 B2B accounts ($4.79M ARR) that converted from the PLG motion to identify which product-qualified leads become high-value customers
- Built multi-factor scoring model combining firmographics with behavioral signals (renewal frequency, seat adoption, multi-tier usage)
- Key finding: 51-200 employee segment delivers 2.6x higher ARR than 11-50 band; top 15% of accounts generate 66% of revenue

**Tacit Knowledge Extraction:**
- Built 43 structured profiles distilled from public case studies using a 3-phase extraction framework: identifying the unsaid → universal mechanism identification → cross-vertical pattern mapping
- Identified the universal buyer mechanism: coordination latency and visibility gaps in high-volume asynchronous outreach
- Context Engine architecture with reconciliation protocols, provenance tracking, and dependency management

**Value-First Outreach:**
- Developed internal tools and solutions designed as lead magnets—providing value before the ask
- Email sequences structured to deliver genuine value in the first touchpoint

**Documentation & Methodology:**
- Authored the GTM Intelligence Compendium (comprehensive methodology documentation)
- 30+ strategic documents, GTM onboarding system, modular email variance testing framework (A/B/C testing with isolated variables)

**Technologies:** Claude Code, Claude API, Cursor, Python/Pandas, Jupyter, Clay, SmartLead, ScaledMail, HeyReach, Octave, Triggify, Phantom Buster, Discolike, Wispr Flow, Obsidian

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**How I got the role:**
- GTM Engineering School (first cohort, June 2025)
- CRO Heath Barnett was in the same course
- Built relationship through class engagement
- 2-week trial ($7,500) → 3-month contract ($30K)

**My background coming in:**
- SDR experience at Biofourmis (generated significant revenue, originated deals)
- Worked directly with the CRO daily at Mixmax
- Head of RevOps was my counterpart—close collaboration
- Not my first time in the arena

**What actually happened:**
- Stepped into a PLG company with no outbound—revenue came from inbound PQLs and individual users converting to B2B team accounts
- CRO had killed all outbound when he arrived a year prior—I was building from zero
- Full autonomy, full budget, owned everything outbound
- First month: infrastructure (53 inboxes, domain warming, tech stack)
- Built 9-agent framework, scoring models, intelligence compendium

**Company context:**
- Mixmax had been Series B for nearly a decade (PLG model)
- AEs were leaving; budget needed to shift to hiring SDRs
- Rebrand pivot: Mixmax.com → Mixmax AI
- C-Suite expected immediate revenue—GTM engineering from zero takes 30+ days of infrastructure before campaigns even start

**What I delivered:**
- 4+ campaigns executed
- Complete 9-agent autonomous GTM system
- 53-inbox email infrastructure (multi-provider)
- Academic-quality GTM Intelligence Compendium
- ICP validation (280 customers, $4.79M ARR analyzed)
- 43 structured case study profiles
- 30+ strategic documents
- Campaign framework with $300K revenue plan documented

**How it ended:**
- Departed after completing the engagement
- Left them with all the technology and the production-ready system
- Trained their head of RevOps on how to run it internally—they can execute without me
- Relationship professional

**What Heath (CRO) would probably say:**
"He's talented. Creative. Genuinely wants to do great work. But he struggled with execution—he'd spend weeks building the perfect framework when I needed campaigns out the door. That said—he owned it at the end. Didn't make excuses. Asked for feedback."

**If asked "What would you do differently?":**
- Communicate timeline expectations upfront: "Infrastructure takes a month. Results take 60-90 days. Are you committed to that?"
- Ship minimum viable campaigns first, then build the comprehensive system

**Red flags for future roles:**
- "Full autonomy" without engaged leadership = danger zone for me
- Need clear, time-bound deliverables with check-ins
- Can't be the only person who understands the system I'm building
