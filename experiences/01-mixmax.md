## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**How I got the role:**
- Paid for Go-To-Market Engineering School (first cohort, June 2025)
- CRO Heath Barnett was in the same course
- Built relationship through engagement in classes, asking questions
- Got 2-week trial contract ($7,500) — campaign didn't drive revenue but worked well with team
- Converted to 3-month contract: $30k ($5k/biweekly)

**What actually happened:**
- Full autonomy, full budget, owned everything outbound
- CRO had killed all outbound when he arrived a year prior — I was rebuilding from zero
- First month consumed by infrastructure setup (domains, inboxes, warming)
- Got lost building "perfect" frameworks and value propositions instead of shipping campaigns
- Asked team for help on value offers — nobody had ideas, couldn't think of anything valuable
- Built internal apps, trackers, elaborate systems — bit off more than I could chew
- When they pivoted direction, I'd already spent weeks on frameworks that got scrapped

**The deliverable gap:**
- Was asked to deliver 9,000 contacts across 3 campaigns (A, B, C) by December 12
- Delivered ~3,770 total
- Contract ended early (December 12 instead of January 1)

**What I learned:**
- Full autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me
- I need someone engaged enough to redirect when I'm going too deep
- Ship ugly and iterate beats beautiful and stuck
- "Ship first, buzzer-beater second" is now my operating principle

**What Heath would probably say:**
"He's talented. Creative. Genuinely wants to do great work. But he struggled with execution — he'd spend weeks building the perfect framework when I needed campaigns out the door. Organization wasn't his strength. He didn't deliver what we agreed on by the deadline we set. That said — he owned it at the end. Didn't make excuses. Asked for feedback."

**How it ended:**
- Payment confusion arose (trial invoices counted toward contract total)
- I sent thorough handoff documentation after contract ended
- Final message from Heath: "Please keep all communication going forward over email"
- Relationship strained but not burned — I owned my shortcomings in final message

**Red flags for future roles:**
- "Full autonomy" without engaged leadership = danger zone for me
- Need clear, time-bound deliverables with check-ins
- Can't be the only person who understands the system I'm building
