## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**Context:**
- This was during the gap period after getting fired from Biofourmis
- Couldn't find another opportunity like that for 6+ months
- Was also working at Home Depot pushing carts to pay rent

**The work with Josh Pappas:**
- Ex-Biofourmis mentor, most tenured person there, director-level
- He left and was pursuing side hustles with startup founders
- I helped him with various projects
- Kept my foot in the game while waiting for right opportunity

**Bariatric Centers of America / BariNav:**
- Dr. Mike Blaney — bariatric surgeon in Augusta
- He developed software himself on Salesforce Health Cloud
- I helped build GTM funnel and overall outbound process
- Strategy for getting in touch with hospitals and piloting the software
- $299 contract work — did it for experience, relationship, potential upside
- Product metrics: 113% patient growth, 213% surgery volume growth
- NDA signed May 17, 2024
- Built $200K+ early-stage pipeline, 20+ net-new leads
- Project is still going — I still occasionally help with cold outbound and GTM strategy

**Why this matters:**
- Shows I stayed in the game during a tough period
- Refused to take a "smile and dial" job just for paycheck
- Built real consulting experience even while pushing carts
