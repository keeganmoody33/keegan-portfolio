## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**Why I was there:**
- Gap year — was supposed to be going to medical school
- COVID hit, needed income
- Was also working special ed and coaching football before this

**What I actually saw:**
- The business side of healthcare is grimy
- This office wouldn't accept insurance patients — only legal cases and pay-upfront
- Patients with injury cases (car accidents) would get inflated or extended treatment
- Goal was to deplete the case money
- Backroom deals with lawyers
- A scam with a stethoscope

**My role in it:**
- Front desk — had keys, trained people, processed paperwork, handled intake
- I wasn't designing the scheme, but I was in the room
- Owner told me to keep my head down
- I did. I got out when I could.

**Why this matters:**
- This experience is WHY I turned down medical school (Miami, late acceptance)
- Seeing the machine up close made me pivot
- "I was turned off by the business aspect. I could impact the community in ways beyond delivery of care."

**I don't talk about this publicly** — but it's important context for why I left medicine.
