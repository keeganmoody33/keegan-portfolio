**Location:** Remote  
**Reporting To:** Heath Barnett, CRO

- Built scalable Clay tables with automated enrichment pipelines integrating Trigify, Apollo, and custom data sources

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**How I got the role:**
- Paid for Go-To-Market Engineering School (first cohort, June 2025)
- CRO Heath Barnett was in the same course
- Built relationship through engagement in classes, asking questions
- Got 2-week trial contract ($7,500) — campaign didn't drive revenue but worked well with team
- Converted to 3-month contract: $30k ($5k/biweekly)

**What actually happened:**
- Full autonomy, full budget, owned everything outbound
- CRO had killed all outbound when he arrived a year prior — I was rebuilding from zero
- First month consumed by infrastructure setup (domains, inboxes, warming)
- Got lost building "perfect" frameworks and value propositions instead of shipping campaigns
- Asked team for help on value offers — nobody had ideas, couldn't think of anything valuable
- Built internal apps, trackers, elaborate systems — bit off more than I could chew
- When they pivoted direction, I'd already spent weeks on frameworks that got scrapped

**The deliverable gap:**
- Was asked to deliver 9,000 contacts across 3 campaigns (A, B, C) by December 12
- Delivered ~3,770 total
- Contract ended early (December 12 instead of January 1)

**What I learned:**
- Full autonomy without check-ins doesn't work for me
- I need someone engaged enough to redirect when I'm going too deep
- Ship ugly and iterate beats beautiful and stuck
- "Ship first, buzzer-beater second" is now my operating principle

**What Heath would probably say:**
"He's talented. Creative. Genuinely wants to do great work. But he struggled with execution — he'd spend weeks building the perfect framework when I needed campaigns out the door. Organization wasn't his strength. He didn't deliver what we agreed on by the deadline we set. That said — he owned it at the end. Didn't make excuses. Asked for feedback."

**How it ended:**
- Payment confusion arose (trial invoices counted toward contract total)
- I sent thorough handoff documentation after contract ended
- Final message from Heath: "Please keep all communication going forward over email"
- Relationship strained but not burned — I owned my shortcomings in final message

**Red flags for future roles:**
- "Full autonomy" without engaged leadership = danger zone for me
- Need clear, time-bound deliverables with check-ins
- Can't be the only person who understands the system I'm building

## Role 2: Trace Air — Sales Development Representative

**Company:** Trace Air (Land Development Software/Service)  
**Duration:** June/July 2024 – January 2025  
**Location:** Remote  
**Reporting To:** Corey Jordan, SDR Manager

### PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Sales Development Representative

**Summary:**
SDR responsible for greenfield territory development in construction and land development vertical, consistently exceeding targets through creative prospecting and self-sourced lead generation.

**Bullets:**
- Achieved record month of 20 demos booked, with 18 (90%) from self-sourced contacts outside existing CRM database
- Developed custom prospecting methodology using ChatGPT to identify upcoming major land developments and decision-makers
- Built territory from scratch with limited resources — 2,200 contacts vs. 8,800 in comparable territories
- Created personalized video outreach strategy via LinkedIn achieving higher engagement than templated sequences
- Partnered with 2 Account Executives simultaneously to optimize handoff process and demo conversion

**Key Technologies:** Salesforce, SalesLoft, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ChatGPT

---

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**The situation when I arrived:**
- Team of 3 SDRs — 2 got let go right when I started (weren't performing)
- Just me, another new hire (Jillian), and SDR manager Corey Jordan
- Holly (top performer, still my friend) was crushing quota (15 demos/month)
- Greenfield territory — no tools, no resources provided internally

**The territory problem:**
- My territory: ~2,200 contacts
- Another SDR's territory: ~8,800 contacts
- Same quota expectations, same call metrics
- Finite contacts in Salesforce — couldn't add new ones without scrutiny
- Previous SDR in my territory had never hit quota
- Working with AEs who had no current business and hadn't closed deals

**What I actually built:**
- Started with LinkedIn — manually sending personalized videos
- Used ChatGPT to find "next big developments within the next decade" in major cities
- Identified who was running each development
- Called them, referenced their specific project, sparked interest
- Introduced Trace Air's value prop around volume metrics and scheduling visibility

**The friction:**
- October: Moving slower than record September, not on track for quota
- SDR manager sent email tagging VP of Sales — not a PIP but a warning
- Nobody else got that email despite also not being on track
- Felt targeted

**The call that got me fired:**
- Team call, Holly mentioned grievances
- Corey said: "It's not like your house is burning down"
- I jumped in, said my house IS burning — I need leads, I need tools
- Advocated for myself and the team
- Wasn't yelling but was confrontational
- Corey hopped off call immediately, started politicking with other team members
- Beginning of January: I was late/missed a meeting
- Next call was with HR — fired

**Despite:**
- Being top performer
- 20 demos in one month
- 18 contacts I sourced myself (not in their Salesforce)

**What Corey would probably say:**
"He was not what they needed. Talented maybe. Would say I'm a slacker. Didn't like me, felt threatened."

**What I'd do differently:**
- Pick battles more carefully
- Same message, different delivery — less confrontational
- Document everything before escalating

**Pattern recognition:**
This is the second time I was top performer and got fired for not playing the game. The lesson about optics I learned at Biofourmis — I still fell short on it here.

## Role 3: Biofourmis — Co-Founding SDR

**Company:** Biofourmis Inc. (Digital Health / Remote Patient Monitoring)  
**Duration:** August 2021 – January 2022 (~8 months)  
**Location:** Remote  
**Reporting To:** Sheezah Hussain, Chief Commercial Officer

### PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Co-Founding Sales Development Representative, Commercial Care

**Summary:**
First SDR hire for Commercial Care vertical at Series B digital health company, helping scale commercial operations through unicorn valuation within 8 months.

**Bullets:**
- Originated Orlando Health partnership generating $1M+ in lifetime revenue — fastest deal close in company history (90 days)
- Developed targeted prospecting methodology identifying hospitals exceeding federal ER readmission thresholds and engaging Quality Assurance leadership
- Built and led SDR team processes including dashboards, meeting cadences, and pipeline reporting as team scaled to 3 reps
- Established relationships with major academic medical institutions including University of Florida and NYU Langone
- Contributed to company growth from Series B/C to unicorn valuation ($1B+) within first year

**Key Technologies:** HubSpot, ZoomInfo, Salesforce

---

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**How I got the role:**
- Applied cold on LinkedIn
- Interviewed by Chief Commercial Officer Sheezah Hussain
- Science background (biochemistry, organic chemistry, published research) got their attention
- First real sales job

**What I actually did:**
- SDR work — generating leads, cold calling, 500 sequenced emails in HubSpot
- ZoomInfo was new tool at the time
- Essentially a GTM engineer before the title existed — free rein to build
- No reporting manager — reported directly to CCO
- Got into highly technical conversations as software updated
- Met with CTO in Singapore, learned about Kafka buses, anonymizing medical IDs

**The Orlando Health deal:**
- My biggest win
- Found them by researching hospitals over federal ER readmission limits
- Identified Director of Quality Assurance as decision-maker
- Set demo with AE Tyler Cole (still there today)
- Fastest deal they ever closed — 90 days
- I didn't close it, but I originated it
- Still generating revenue today — estimated $1M+ lifetime

**My approach vs. their expectations:**
- They expected 80 calls/day
- My process: 20-40 focused, meaningful calls
- I led the team in results quarter over quarter
- But not in daily activity metrics

**The friction:**
- CCO didn't understand day-to-day SDR work
- No intermediate managers to bridge the gap
- Got pressure on activity numbers despite results

**How it ended:**
- Fired in January
- Pushing numbers without understanding quality over quantity
- CCO ended up leaving too
- My mentor Josh Pappas (most tenured, director-level) was also leaving
- They kept the "teacher's pet, follow the rules" type person

**What I learned:**
- Optics are everything
- Sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy
- Prove things with numbers that THEY care about, not just results
- This lesson stuck with me but I still fell short on it later

**This was my first sales job:**
- I didn't understand how good I had it
- Didn't know the game well enough to navigate politics

## Role 4: GTM Consulting (Contract Work)

**Company:** Various (Josh Pappas projects, Bariatric Centers of America / BariNav)  
**Duration:** January 2022 – June 2024 (intermittent)  
**Location:** Remote  
**Type:** Contract / Consulting

### PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Go-To-Market Consultant

**Summary:**
Independent GTM consulting for early-stage healthcare technology companies, specializing in outbound process development and hospital/health system sales strategy.

**Bullets:**

- Collaborated with former Biofourmis leadership on startup advisory and commercial strategy projects
- Maintained ongoing advisory relationships with healthcare technology founders

**Key Focus Areas:** Healthcare GTM, Hospital Sales, Outbound Process Design

---

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**Context:**
- This was during the gap period after getting fired from Biofourmis
- Couldn't find another opportunity like that for 6+ months
- Was also working at Home Depot pushing carts to pay rent

**The work with Josh Pappas:**
- Ex-Biofourmis mentor, most tenured person there, director-level
- He left and was pursuing side hustles with startup founders
- I helped him with various projects
- Kept my foot in the game while waiting for right opportunity

**Bariatric Centers of America / BariNav:**
- Dr. Mike Blaney — bariatric surgeon in Augusta
- He developed software himself
- I helped build GTM funnel and overall outbound process
- Strategy for getting in touch with hospitals and piloting the software
- $299 contract work — did it for experience, relationship, potential upside
- Project is still going — I still occasionally help with cold outbound and GTM strategy

**Why this matters:**
- Shows I stayed in the game during a tough period
- Refused to take a "smile and dial" job just for paycheck
- Built real consulting experience even while pushing carts

## Role 5: Barbour Orthopedics — Front Desk Associate

**Company:** Barbour Orthopedics  
**Duration:** ~18-24 months (during gap year / COVID period)  
**Location:** In-person  
**Type:** Full-time

### PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Front Office Associate

**Summary:**
Front desk operations for orthopedic medical practice, managing patient intake, staff training, and office administration during COVID-19 transition period.

**Bullets:**
- Managed patient intake processes and documentation for multi-provider orthopedic practice
- Trained new staff on office procedures and patient management systems
- Held keys and opening/closing responsibilities across multiple office locations
- Optimized front desk workflows and patient paperwork processes

---

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**Why I was there:**
- Gap year — was supposed to be going to medical school
- COVID hit, needed income
- Was also working special ed and coaching football before this

**What I actually saw:**
- The business side of healthcare is grimy
- This office wouldn't accept insurance patients — only legal cases and pay-upfront
- Patients with injury cases (car accidents) would get inflated or extended treatment
- Goal was to deplete the case money
- Backroom deals with lawyers
- A scam with a stethoscope

**My role in it:**
- Front desk — had keys, trained people, processed paperwork, handled intake
- I wasn't designing the scheme, but I was in the room
- Owner told me to keep my head down
- I did. I got out when I could.

**Why this matters:**
- This experience is WHY I turned down medical school (Miami, late acceptance)
- Seeing the machine up close made me pivot
- "I was turned off by the business aspect. I could impact the community in ways beyond delivery of care."

**I don't talk about this publicly** — but it's important context for why I left medicine.

## Role 6: Mercury Research — Research Assistant

**Institution:** University (with Dr. Adam Kiefer)  
**Duration:** ~270 days total fieldwork in South America  
**Location:** Peru, South America  
**Type:** Academic Research

### PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Research Assistant — Environmental Health / Mercury Exposure

**Summary:**
Field researcher studying mercury vapor exposure from artisanal gold mining operations in South America, developing novel data collection methodologies and publishing peer-reviewed findings.

**Bullets:**

---

### PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**The mentor:**
- Dr. Adam Kiefer — young guy from Newark, New Jersey
- Organic chemistry professor, did research in South American gold mines
- He's the goat to me

**What he taught me:**
- "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop."
- "You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."
- There are things I've done to be proud of (I still struggle with this)

**What we actually did:**
- 270 days total in South America
- Portable spectrophotometer (Ohio Lumex) measuring mercury vapor
- ASGM process: miners dump liquid mercury on ore, forms amalgam, burn it off with aerosolized gasoline
- Mercury vaporizes, people inhale it, creates Mercury Minamata disease ("mad as a hatter")

**The methodology I built:**
- Walked miles through cities with Ohio Lumex and laptop
- Paired Lumex readings with Garmin GPS — both set to exact same time to the second
- Matched concentration with longitude/latitude
- Created heat maps showing harmful areas
- Excel work: VLOOKUPs, concatenations, data pairing
- Long nights where one space could break everything

**The conditions:**
- Hostel to hostel through sketchy areas
- Non-Spanish speakers navigating alone
- Juan Cavallico — 14,000 feet, cinnabar mines
- Community of Saxo Marca (fell victim to Shining Path)

**The approach:**
- "Not be the white guy that comes in and tells you you're doing things wrong"
- Find alternative methods for gold purification that don't destroy their economy

**Why this matters for GTM:**
- Scientific method → frameworks, hypothesis testing, iteration
- Building methodology from scratch with limited resources
- Detail obsession, data pairing, finding patterns
- Working through ambiguity in challenging environments

- Sleep in same bunk as the kid for a full week
- Spent a full month total with someone who doesn't have parents
- "I could be the most influential male in this kid's life"
- "A lot of people complain about the community. Very few are actually out there trying to impact change."
