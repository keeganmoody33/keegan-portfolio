**Company:** Mobb AI (Code Vulnerability Remediation Platform)
**Duration:** May 2025 - June 2025 (2 months)
**Location:** Remote
**Type:** Contract

## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** GTM Strategy & Market Intelligence

**Summary:**
Developed pain-based segmentation framework targeting pre-IPO companies facing SEC cybersecurity compliance gaps. Adopted Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture within the first week of release—learning the full stack and immediately applying SEC EDGAR integration to automate regulatory filing analysis, enabling permissionless value proposition (PVP) development for go-to-market targeting.

**Bullets:**
- Developed pain-based segmentation framework targeting pre-IPO companies facing SEC cybersecurity compliance gaps, identifying $202M total addressable market across four urgency tiers
- Created proprietary "Existential Data Point" formula (Days to IPO ÷ Days to Clear Compliance) to score and prioritize prospects by conversion likelihood
- Adopted Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture within the first week of release—integrating SEC EDGAR with a local Claude setup for automated regulatory filing analysis and real-time compliance crisis detection, accelerating PVP development and segmentation hypothesis testing
- Built detection methodology combining SEC comment letters, material weakness disclosures, and 2023 cybersecurity rule gaps to identify companies where IPO timelines were mathematically blocked
- Contributed to Product Hunt launch strategy for Mobb Vibe Shield, positioning the product within the emerging MCP ecosystem for CI/CD security tooling

**Key Outcome:** Segmentation model projected 85% of revenue potential concentrated in top two crisis segments (EDP < 0.7), enabling focused outbound targeting with premium pricing justification.

**Key Technologies:** Claude MCP, SEC EDGAR, Pain-Based Segmentation

## WEBSITE VERSION (Portfolio Copy)

I quickly adopted Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) the week it launched, unlocking expanded capabilities through its public API integrations. By connecting MCP to SEC EDGAR, I was able to analyze S-1 filings and extract key insights, particularly focused on the SEC's security-related comments. These insights highlighted urgent needs and actionable solutions for prospective companies, effectively shaping what I consider a PVP (Permissionless Value Proposition)—a strategy popularized by Cannonball GTM.

**Key Points:**
- Early adoption of Anthropic's MCP (the week it launched)
- Integration with SEC EDGAR for real-time insights
- Focused on security-related SEC comments
- Developed messaging prospective companies would pay to receive

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**The problem I solved:**
Mobb AI is a code vulnerability remediation platform. The GTM challenge: how do you find companies who *need* automated vulnerability fixing right now—not someday? Traditional firmographic targeting doesn't answer the urgency question.

**The insight:**
Pre-IPO companies can't afford security vulnerabilities:
- SEC comment letters on cybersecurity literally block IPOs
- Material weaknesses require public disclosure to investors
- 2023 SEC cybersecurity rules created new compliance gaps
- Timeline pressure makes remediation speed existential

This isn't a "nice to have." This is existential pain with a deadline.

**What I built:**

### 1. Existential Data Point (EDP) Formula
```
EDP = Days Until IPO ÷ Days to Clear Compliance Issues
```
- EDP < 1.0 → IPO is mathematically impossible without intervention
- EDP 0.1-0.3 → Crisis mode, IPO blocked
- EDP 0.3-0.7 → Emergency, IPO at serious risk
- EDP 0.7-1.2 → Urgent but manageable
- EDP > 1.2 → Prevention-focused, lower urgency

### 2. Pain-Based Segmentation Model

| Segment | EDP Range | Conversion Rate | ACV | ARR Potential |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----|---------------|
| SEC Comment Crisis | 0.1-0.3 | 85% | $500K-2M | $112M (56%) |
| Material Weakness Emergency | 0.3-0.7 | 65% | $200K-800K | $58M (29%) |
| New Rule Scramble | 0.7-1.2 | 40% | $100K-400K | $24M (12%) |
| Proactive Preparation | >1.2 | 15% | $50K-150K | $8M (3%) |

**Total Addressable Revenue: $202M**

### 3. MCP Integration (First-Week Adoption)
- Adopted SEC EDGAR MCP server within the first week of release—learned the full stack and immediately applied it to GTM workflow
- Set up local Claude environment for rapid data processing and segmentation hypothesis testing
- Automated regulatory filing analysis to accelerate permissionless value proposition (PVP) development using the Cannonball GTM methodology (Jordan Crawford / Doug Bell)
- Early adoption enabled rapid experimentation, positioning the initiative at the forefront of leveraging AI infrastructure for pain-based targeting

**What didn't ship (but still matters):**
- Product Hunt launch plan for Mobb Vibe Shield
- Positioning strategy for MCP-native security products
- Plan was developed but not deployed during engagement

**Key learnings:**
1. Regulatory pressure creates the most urgent pain
2. Public data (SEC filings) is underutilized for GTM
3. First-week adoption of AI tooling (MCP + local Claude) enables rapid experimentation and differentiation
4. Pain intensity predicts conversion better than company size

**Why this matters for portfolio:**
- Demonstrates pain-based segmentation methodology
- Shows technical sophistication (MCP early adopter)
- Quantified market sizing with conversion assumptions
- Combined strategic thinking with technical implementation
