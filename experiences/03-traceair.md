## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**The situation when I arrived:**
- Team of 3 SDRs — 2 got let go right when I started (weren't performing)
- Just me, another new hire (Jillian), and SDR manager Corey Jordan
- Holly (top performer, still my friend) was crushing quota (15 demos/month)
- Greenfield territory — no tools, no resources provided internally

**The territory problem:**
- My territory: ~2,200 contacts
- Another SDR's territory: ~8,800 contacts
- Same quota expectations, same call metrics
- Finite contacts in Salesforce — couldn't add new ones without scrutiny
- Previous SDR in my territory had never hit quota
- Working with AEs who had no current business and hadn't closed deals

**What I actually built:**
- Started with LinkedIn — manually sending personalized videos
- Used ChatGPT to find "next big developments within the next decade" in major cities
- Identified who was running each development
- Called them, referenced their specific project, sparked interest
- Introduced Trace Air's value prop around volume metrics and scheduling visibility

**The friction:**
- October: Moving slower than record September, not on track for quota
- SDR manager sent email tagging VP of Sales — not a PIP but a warning
- Nobody else got that email despite also not being on track
- Felt targeted

**The call that got me fired:**
- Team call, Holly mentioned grievances
- Corey said: "It's not like your house is burning down"
- I jumped in, said my house IS burning — I need leads, I need tools
- Advocated for myself and the team
- Wasn't yelling but was confrontational
- Corey hopped off call immediately, started politicking with other team members
- Beginning of January: I was late/missed a meeting
- Next call was with HR — fired

**Despite:**
- Being top performer
- 23 demos in one month (record)
- Majority self-sourced (not in their Salesforce)
- $216,437.50 closed-won revenue

**What Corey would probably say:**
"He was not what they needed. Talented maybe. Would say I'm a slacker. Didn't like me, felt threatened."

**What I'd do differently:**
- Pick battles more carefully
- Same message, different delivery — less confrontational
- Document everything before escalating

**Pattern recognition:**
This is the second time I was top performer and got fired for not playing the game. The lesson about optics I learned at Biofourmis — I still fell short on it here.
