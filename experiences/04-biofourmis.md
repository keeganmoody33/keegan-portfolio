## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**How I got the role:**
- Applied cold on LinkedIn
- Interviewed by Chief Commercial Officer Sheezah Hussain
- Science background (biochemistry, organic chemistry, published research) got their attention
- First real sales job

**What I actually did:**
- SDR work — generating leads, cold calling, 500 sequenced emails in HubSpot
- ZoomInfo was new tool at the time
- Essentially a GTM engineer before the title existed — free rein to build
- No reporting manager — reported directly to CCO
- Got into highly technical conversations as software updated
- Met with CTO in Singapore, learned about Kafka buses, anonymizing medical IDs

**The Orlando Health deal:**
- My biggest win
- Found them by researching hospitals over federal ER readmission limits
- Identified Director of Quality Assurance as decision-maker
- Set demo with AE Tyler Cole (still there today)
- Fastest deal they ever closed — 90 days
- I didn't close it, but I originated it
- Still generating revenue today — estimated $1M+ lifetime

**My approach vs. their expectations:**
- They expected 80 calls/day
- My process: 20-40 focused, meaningful calls
- I led the team in results quarter over quarter
- But not in daily activity metrics

**The friction:**
- CCO didn't understand day-to-day SDR work
- No intermediate managers to bridge the gap
- Got pressure on activity numbers despite results

**How it ended:**
- Fired in January
- Pushing numbers without understanding quality over quantity
- CCO ended up leaving too
- My mentor Josh Pappas (most tenured, director-level) was also leaving
- They kept the "teacher's pet, follow the rules" type person

**What I learned:**
- Optics are everything
- Sometimes you have to fall in line and keep everybody happy
- Prove things with numbers that THEY care about, not just results
- This lesson stuck with me but I still fell short on it later

**This was my first sales job:**
- I didn't understand how good I had it
- Didn't know the game well enough to navigate politics
