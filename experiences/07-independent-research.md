## PUBLIC VERSION (LinkedIn-Appropriate)

**Title:** Research Assistant — Environmental Health / Mercury Exposure

**Summary:**
Field researcher studying mercury vapor exposure from artisanal gold mining operations in South America, developing novel data collection methodologies and publishing peer-reviewed findings.

**Bullets:**
- Conducted 120+ days of fieldwork across South American mining communities measuring elemental mercury vapor concentrations
- Developed methodology pairing portable spectrophotometry (Ohio Lumex) with GPS tracking for geographic concentration mapping
- Created heat maps identifying high-risk exposure areas to inform community health interventions
- Published peer-reviewed research on ASGM (Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining) environmental health impacts
- Worked in challenging field conditions including high-altitude locations (14,000+ feet) and remote communities

**Publications:**
- 2 Elsevier papers on mercury emissions

**Key Skills:** Data Collection, Field Research, Spectrophotometry, GPS Mapping, Excel (VLOOKUP, Data Pairing), Scientific Writing

## PRIVATE VERSION (Honest AI Context)

**The mentor:**
- Dr. Adam Kiefer — young guy from Newark, New Jersey
- Organic chemistry professor, did research in South American gold mines
- He's the goat to me

**What he taught me:**
- "Nobody cares. Your complaints, your lack of responsibility — nobody cares. So stop."
- "You're not gonna make a difference in the world. You can try, you can attempt — it's our job to try."
- There are things I've done to be proud of (I still struggle with this)

**What we actually did:**
- 120 days total in South America
- Portable spectrophotometer (Ohio Lumex) measuring mercury vapor
- ASGM process: miners dump liquid mercury on ore, forms amalgam, burn it off with aerosolized gasoline
- Mercury vaporizes, people inhale it, creates Mercury Minamata disease ("mad as a hatter")

**The methodology I built:**
- Walked miles through cities with Ohio Lumex and laptop
- Paired Lumex readings with Garmin GPS — both set to exact same time to the second
- Matched concentration with longitude/latitude
- Created heat maps showing harmful areas
- Excel work: VLOOKUPs, concatenations, data pairing
- Long nights where one space could break everything

**The conditions:**
- Hostel to hostel through sketchy areas
- Non-Spanish speakers navigating alone
- Juan Cavallico — 14,000 feet, cinnabar mines
- Community of Saxo Marca (fell victim to Shining Path)

**The approach:**
- "Not be the white guy that comes in and tells you you're doing things wrong"
- Find alternative methods for gold purification that don't destroy their economy

**Why this matters for GTM:**
- Scientific method → frameworks, hypothesis testing, iteration
- Building methodology from scratch with limited resources
- Detail obsession, data pairing, finding patterns
- Working through ambiguity in challenging environments
